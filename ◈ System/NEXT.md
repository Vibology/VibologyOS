# Current Work Context

**Last Session:** 2026-01-09
**Current Focus:** Tarot Minor Arcana - Wands suit comprehensive revision

## Recent Completions

### ✅ 2026-01-09: Universal Library Content Standard Rubric (EXPANDED)
Created comprehensive quality rubric (`RUBRIC - Library Content Standard.md`) that generalizes the Tarot Minor Arcana standard to work across all Seven Pillars. Massively expanded all 7 system appendices (Tarot, Human Design, Astrology, Qabalah, I-Ching, Folklore/Jungian, Angelology) with ~2000+ lines of detailed, prescriptive guidance. Each appendix includes canonical sources, YAML templates, synthesis requirements, and 900-1100+ word exemplary examples. This is now the authoritative template for all library content (Tier 3 = research-grade target). Commits: 1af220d, b45352b

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Begin Next Suit (Cups, Swords, or Pentacles)
The Wands suit is now complete (all 14 cards at comprehensive Tier 3 standard). Next suit options:
1. **Cups** (Water element, emotion, relationships, the unconscious)
2. **Swords** (Air element, intellect, conflict, truth, mental clarity)
3. **Pentacles** (Earth element, material world, body, resources, manifestation)

Recommended approach: Begin with **Cups** to continue elemental progression (Fire → Water → Air → Earth).

### Priority 2: Apply Universal Rubric to Non-Tarot Content
Consider revising existing Tier 1 entries in Human Design or Astrology to Tier 3 (comprehensive) using the new universal rubric.
