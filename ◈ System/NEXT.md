## Available Work Paths

### Priority 1: The Magdalene Path Development
**Why:** Only incomplete pillar remaining. Framework defined but content needs creation.

**Approach:**
- Define core structure (stages, practices, devotions)
- Research canonical sources (Gnostic Gospels, Mary Magdalene traditions)
- Create foundational entries following established Tier 3 standards

### Priority 2: Cross-System Synthesis Demonstrations
**Why:** Core competency of VibologyOS - multi-dimensional synthesis across all systems.

**Suggested Topics:**
- The Tower archetype across all systems (Tarot + Astrology + HD + Qabalah + Jungian)
- Saturn Return synthesis (Astrology + HD + Tarot + Jungian + Angelology)
- Gate 51 / Aries 19° / The Tower / Shock: Complete cross-system analysis

### Priority 3: Process Gap Resolution
**Remaining Medium-Priority Gaps (2):**
- Client Work Protocol (chart storage, reading structure, delivery format, confidentiality standards)
- Synthesis Templates & Standards (for ⚛ Synthesis/ folder content)

### Priority 4: Library Maintenance
**Next Quarterly Audit:** Not due yet (protocol established 2026-01-10, 90-day cycle)

**Ad-Hoc Maintenance:**
- Link verification (grep for broken [[wikilinks]])
- Tag consistency checks
- Incomplete stub identification
