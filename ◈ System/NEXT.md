# Current Work Context

**Last Session:** 2026-01-10
**Current Focus:** Tarot Minor Arcana + System Infrastructure (Cross-System Synthesis Protocol)

## Recent Completions

### ✅ 2026-01-10: Cross-System Synthesis Protocol (PROCESS GAP #1 COMPLETE)
Implemented comprehensive methodology for synthesizing across esoteric systems (Tarot, HD, Astrology, Qabalah, I-Ching, Jungian, Angelology) to create unified, multi-dimensional insight. Created:
- `PROTOCOL - Cross-System Synthesis.md` (24-page comprehensive guide with 7-step process)
- `⚛ Synthesis/_TEMPLATE - Cross-System Synthesis.md` (standalone template for synthesis pieces)
- CLAUDE.md Section 10 (integration with AI workflow)
- Clear distinction between Library entries (single-system reference) vs. Synthesis pieces (multi-system integration)
- File location conventions, quality standards, example scenarios
**Impact:** Cross-system synthesis is now systematic and replicable rather than purely intuitive. Provides framework for VibologyOS's core competency. Commit: 6d56251

### ✅ 2026-01-09: Universal Library Content Standard Rubric (EXPANDED)
Created comprehensive quality rubric (`RUBRIC - Library Content Standard.md`) that generalizes the Tarot Minor Arcana standard to work across all Seven Pillars. Massively expanded all 7 system appendices (Tarot, Human Design, Astrology, Qabalah, I-Ching, Folklore/Jungian, Angelology) with ~2000+ lines of detailed, prescriptive guidance. Each appendix includes canonical sources, YAML templates, synthesis requirements, and 900-1100+ word exemplary examples. This is now the authoritative template for all library content (Tier 3 = research-grade target). Commits: 1af220d, b45352b

  - King of Wands: 79→526 lines (Fire of Fire, active master, visionary command, creative sovereignty)

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Begin Next Suit (Cups, Swords, or Pentacles)
The Wands suit is now complete (all 14 cards at comprehensive Tier 3 standard). Next suit options:
1. **Cups** (Water element, emotion, relationships, the unconscious)
2. **Swords** (Air element, intellect, conflict, truth, mental clarity)
3. **Pentacles** (Earth element, material world, body, resources, manifestation)

Recommended approach: Begin with **Cups** to continue elemental progression (Fire → Water → Air → Earth).

### Priority 2: Create First Cross-System Synthesis Piece (Optional)
Now that the protocol exists, consider creating a universal teaching demonstration (e.g., "The Tower Archetype Across All Systems" or "Saturn Return Synthesis: Astrology + HD + Tarot"). This would test the protocol in practice and provide an example for future work.

### Priority 3: Apply Universal Rubric to Non-Tarot Content
Consider revising existing Tier 1 entries in Human Design or Astrology to Tier 3 (comprehensive) using the new universal rubric.
