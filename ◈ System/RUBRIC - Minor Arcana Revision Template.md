# Minor Arcana Revision Rubric (Phase 2)

## Purpose

This rubric ensures all 56 Minor Arcana cards achieve the same mythopoetic depth and scholarly rigor as the revised Major Arcana. Each card must be earned through transmutation—moving from surface attribution to numinous synthesis.

# {Card Name}: {Title}

## Traditional Symbolism

{Required: 3-5 paragraphs minimum}

### Purpose
Ground the card in source texts before interpretation. This section anchors all subsequent synthesis.

### Content Requirements
1. **Waite's Upright Meanings** - Quote or paraphrase from *Pictorial Key to the Tarot*
2. **Waite's Reversed Meanings** - Include the full reversal interpretation
3. **Golden Dawn Attribution** - The formal title (e.g., "Lord of Material Trouble") and what it signifies
4. **Contextual Interpretation Guidance**:
   - How does the suit element flavor the number/sephirah?
   - How does the planetary ruler through the sign shift meaning?
   - When is this card favorable vs. problematic?
5. **Nuance and Paradox** - Note where traditions disagree or where meaning shifts based on question type

### Voice
Scholarly, precise, grounded. The Scribe reporting what the texts say before The Weaver interprets.

### Example Language Patterns
- "According to Waite's *Pictorial Key*..."
- "The Golden Dawn tradition identifies this as..."
- "The planetary attribution [X in Y] suggests..."
- "This card's meaning shifts dramatically depending on..."
- "Where the upright card represents..., the reversed card speaks to..."

---

## Core Correspondences

{Required: Table format}

### Purpose
Provide at-a-glance reference for all esoteric attributions.

### Table Format
| Attribute | Correspondence |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Number** | {1-10} - {Brief symbolic significance} |
| **Suit** | {Wands/Cups/Swords/Pentacles} - {Element} |
| **Element** | {Fire/Water/Air/Earth} - {Elemental principle} |
| **Sephirah** | {Name} - {Brief essence} |
| **Qabalistic World** | {Atziluth/Briah/Yetzirah/Assiah} - {World principle} |
| **Planetary** | {Planet in Sign} OR {Court attribution} |
| **Decan** | {Zodiac degrees if applicable - for pips 2-10} |
| **Golden Dawn Title** | {Formal title} |
| **Sound** | {Musical note if attributed} |
| **Color** | {Qabalistic color if applicable} |

### Notes
- For **Aces**: Sephirah is Kether, no planetary ruler, title is "Root of the Powers of {Element}"
- For **Court Cards**: Replace planetary with rank attribution (King/Queen/Knight/Page = Fire/Water/Air/Earth of the suit element)
- **Decans** apply to numbered cards 2-10 only

---

## Divination Meanings

{Required: Concise, 1-2 paragraphs each}

### Purpose
Provide clear, practical guidance for readings without over-elaborating.

### Format
**Upright:** {2-3 sentence core meaning}. {1-2 sentence elaboration}.

*Keywords:* {5-8 comma-separated keywords}

**Reversed (per Waite):** {Direct quote or close paraphrase of Waite's reversal}. {1-2 sentence interpretation of what the reversal means psychologically/spiritually}.

### Voice
Clear, direct, actionable. The bridge between theory and practice.

## Synthesis Notes

{Required: 5-10 subsections minimum - this is the heart of the card}

#### 2. The Planetary Expression: {Planet} Through {Sign}
{Skip for Aces and Courts}
- What is the planet's essential nature?
- How does the sign modify or channel that nature?

#### 4. Numerical Progression and Pattern
- Where does this card sit in the 1-10 sequence?
- What came before (the preceding number)?
- What comes after (the next number)?

#### 10. The Central Paradox or Mystery {Optional but recommended}
- What is the irreducible tension or paradox in this card?
- What cannot be resolved, only held?
- What is the koan or riddle?

### Voice
Evocative, scholarly, numinous. Use Jungian terminology. Make mythopoetic connections. The Weaver at full capacity.

### Example Language Patterns
- "The central mystery here is..."
- "This card embodies the paradox of..."
- "In Jungian terms, this represents..."

## Suit-Specific Guidance

### Wands (Fire / Atziluth)
- Emphasis on **will, creativity, action, enterprise**
- Sephiroth represent **spiritual energy descending into creative impulse**
- Shadow: manic energy, burnout, tyranny, destructive will

### Cups (Water / Briah)
- Emphasis on **emotion, relationship, intuition, receptivity**
- Sephiroth represent **emotional states and relational dynamics**
- Shadow: emotional flooding, fusion, fantasy, narcissistic love
- Questions to explore: "What is the quality of the water?" "Is the vessel open or closed?"

### Swords (Air / Yetzirah)
- Emphasis on **thought, conflict, clarity, cutting away**
- Sephiroth represent **mental states and intellectual processes**
- Shadow: cruelty, overthinking, violence, cold logic divorced from feeling

### Pentacles (Earth / Assiah)

- Sephiroth represent **worldly conditions and physical circumstances**
- Shadow: materialism, poverty consciousness, hoarding, disconnection from spirit
- Questions to explore: "What is being built or sustained?" "Is the foundation solid?"

---

## Court Card Specific Guidance

Courts represent **psychological functions** or **actual people** embodying the suit element at different maturity levels.

### Elemental Dignity System
- **King**: Fire of the Suit (active, mature, authoritative)
- **Queen**: Water of the Suit (receptive, mature, nurturing)
- **Knight**: Air of the Suit (active, immature, questing)
- **Page**: Earth of the Suit (receptive, immature, learning)

### Court Card Sections Replace/Modify:
- **No planetary ruler** - instead analyze the elemental combination
- **Emphasize personality typology**: Myers-Briggs, Enneagram, or Jungian function parallels
- **Person vs. Process**: When is this a person in the querent's life vs. an internal process?

---

## Example: Minimal vs. Exemplary

### MINIMAL (Does not pass)
"The Five of Swords is about conflict and loss. It shows someone who won but feels bad about it. Reversed it means defeat."

### EXEMPLARY (Passes rubric)
"The Five of Swords represents the corruption of the blade—Geburah (Severity) expressing through Venus in Aquarius creates the *Lord of Defeat*. According to Waite, this card signifies 'degradation, destruction, revocation, infamy, dishonour, loss.' The figure stands triumphant, yet isolated—he has won the battle but lost the community. The turbulent sky and dejected figures retreating in the background tell the story: this is Pyrrhic victory, the win that costs more than it gains.

In Jungian terms, this is the ego's triumph over the soul—the moment when being 'right' becomes more important than being whole. The shadow expressions include intellectual cruelty, sadistic gloating, and the inability to yield. The gift of integration is recognizing that some battles should not be fought—not because you cannot win, but because the cost of winning destroys what you value most."
