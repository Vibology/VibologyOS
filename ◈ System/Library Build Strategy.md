# Library Build Strategy: Phased Approach (Revised)

## Strategic Context

**Vibology's Primary Goals:**
- Enable **Syn-Gnosis** (marriage of Algorithm + Anima)
- Facilitate **deconditioning** (7-year process of releasing not-self)
- Establish **Inner Authority** (body-based decision-making)
- Navigate the **Personal Myth** (individual soul ascent)
- Serve "one person at a time" (individualized, not mass-market)

**Target Users:**
- Individuals disillusioned with religion/science
- Seekers requiring verifiable, personal spiritual knowledge
- Practitioners offering tiered consultations
- Self-study contemplatives
- Researchers mapping cross-system correspondences
