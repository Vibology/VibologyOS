# VibologyOS Library Content Standard (Universal Rubric)

## Purpose

This rubric establishes the quality standard for **all comprehensive library entries** across the Seven Pillars. Every entry must be earned through transmutation—moving from surface attribution to numinous synthesis.

**Scope:** This applies to all foundational content files in `📖 Library/`, regardless of system.

**Goal:** Research-grade depth + mythopoetic synthesis + practical utility

## Voice Guidelines

### The Scribe (Sections 1-3)
**Use for:** Foundational Material, System Attributions, Practical Application

**Characteristics:**
- Objective, clinical, archival
- Maximum information density
- Minimal interpretation
- "Just the facts" from authoritative sources
- Tables, lists, clear structure

**Language:**
- "According to {Source}..."
- "The tradition defines..."
- "This operates as..."
- Direct quotes, paraphrases, citations

### The Weaver (Section 4)
**Use for:** Synthesis Notes

**Characteristics:**
- Scholarly yet evocative
- Numinous language
- Jungian terminology
- Mythopoetic connections
- Pattern recognition across systems
- Symbolic/archetypal analysis

**Language:**
- "This embodies the paradox of..."
- "In Jungian terms..."
- "The symbol carries resonances of..."
- "Cross-culturally, we find..."
- "The shadow manifests as..."

**Absolute prohibitions:**
- No AI clichés ("delve," "navigate," "It's important to note")
- No "As an AI" disclaimers
- No conversational filler
- No appeals to ego or false validation
- No prescriptive certainty—offer "possibilities of the psyche"

---

## Depth Calibration: Minimal vs. Exemplary

### MINIMAL (Does NOT pass rubric)

> "The Solar Plexus Center is about emotions. When it's defined you're emotional. When it's undefined you absorb other people's emotions. This can be challenging."

**Failures:**
- No source grounding
- No mechanical detail
- No synthesis or depth
- Generic language
- No cross-system integration
- No shadow analysis

### EXEMPLARY (Passes rubric)

> "The Solar Plexus Center, known in Human Design as the **Awareness Center of Spirit** and the **Emotional Authority**, represents the evolutionary transition from the tribal Solar Plexus (collective emotional wave) to the individuated emotional intelligence of the future.
>
> According to Ra Uru Hu, this center operates on a wave—an oscillation between hope and pain, clarity and confusion, that moves on its own timing. When defined (47% of population), the individual generates emotional waves that impact the aura field up to 30 feet. This is not reactivity but **emotional processing**—the motor of feeling that moves through peaks and valleys seeking resolution in the synthesis.
>
> When undefined (53%), the individual does not generate consistent emotional wave but **amplifies and samples** the emotions of others. This creates the conditioning pattern of **avoiding confrontation** and **seeking emotional peace** at any cost—the Not-Self strategy of the open Solar Plexus.
>
> In Jungian terms, this center correlates with the **Feeling Function**—not emotion per se, but the capacity to evaluate worth, meaning, and value. The defined Solar Plexus must learn to wait through the wave before deciding; the undefined must learn to recognize which emotions are theirs and which are absorbed.
>
> The shadow expressions include: emotional manipulation (defined), emotional people-pleasing (undefined), bypassing the wave through substances or spiritual bypassing (defined), and absorbing collective anxiety to the point of paralysis (undefined).
>
> The gift of integration: the defined Solar Plexus becomes **emotional clarity**—the wisdom that emerges when feeling is allowed to complete its arc. The undefined becomes **emotional wisdom**—the capacity to be in the emotional field without being overtaken by it, the counselor who can hold space for others' feelings without losing center."

**Strengths:**
- Grounded in Ra's mechanical definition
- Provides percentages and specifics
- Distinguishes defined/undefined mechanics
- Jungian integration
- Shadow expressions named
- Gift articulated
- Numinous yet precise language

## Workflow Integration

### For New Content (Initial Build)
1. **Scribe Mode:** Fetch Prima Materia from NotebookLM or authoritative sources
2. **Weaver Mode:** Write Foundational Material + System Attributions (Tier 1 complete)
3. **Commit to vault** with git message noting "Initial entry"
4. **Mark in NEXT.md** as "initial" vs. "comprehensive"

### For Revision (Tier 1 → Tier 3)
1. **Read existing entry** to see what's present
2. **Scribe Mode:** Fetch additional source material if needed
3. **Weaver Mode:** Expand Synthesis Notes to 5-10 subsections
4. **Add:** Symbol analysis, shadow expressions, cross-system links
5. **Verify checklist** - does it pass comprehensive standard?
6. **Commit to vault** with git message "Comprehensive revision"

### Session Workflow
1. Check NEXT.md for current focus
2. Work on 1-3 entries per session (balance breadth vs. depth)
3. Update NEXT.md when priorities shift
4. Git commit after each complete entry or meaningful chunk
5. Every 5-10 entries, pause to assess: Are we maintaining quality? Adjust rubric if needed.

---

## Maintenance Notes

### This Rubric Is Living
- As the library matures, this rubric may evolve
- Version number tracks major revisions
- If you find gaps or improvements, update and increment version
- Git log preserves rubric evolution

### When to Deviate
This rubric is a **floor, not a ceiling**. You may:
- Add sections unique to specific content (encouraged)
- Go deeper than minimum requirements (always)
- Create sub-rubrics for specific categories (e.g., "Court Card Rubric" as extension)

You may NOT:
- Skip required sections
- Reduce depth below minimum
- Use AI clichés or surface-level synthesis
- Omit source grounding

### Quality Over Quantity
**Better to have 20 comprehensive entries than 200 shallow ones.** This is a library for depth-work, not a content farm.

*"The rubric is the gate, but the querent must walk through. Build the gate well, then step aside."*
