- Enhance Jungian dimension slightly

### Phase 4: Fine-Tuning (Week 4)
**Focus:** Kamael.md

## Conclusion

This analysis reveals significant variation in content depth across the 11 archangel files. While files like **Raphael**, **Gabriel**, **Michael**, and **Uriel** demonstrate excellent depth and serve as strong templates, files like **Raziel** and **Haniel** require substantial expansion to match the standard.

The clear best practice examples provide concrete models for expansion work. By following the target depth standards and recommended action plan, all 11 archangel files can be brought to a consistent level of scholastic rigor and esoteric depth worthy of the Vibology Library.

**Total Estimated Expansion Needed:** 285-385 lines across 3 files (Raziel, Haniel, Sandalphon)

**Timeline:** 4-5 weeks for complete standardization across all files

---

*Analysis complete. Ready for expansion work to commence.*
