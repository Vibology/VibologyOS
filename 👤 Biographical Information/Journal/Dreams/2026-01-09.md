# Dream: 2026-01-08 (night of the 8th)

## The Dream (Raw Capture)

I dreamed about Donald Trump in a movie where he’s having a giant acid trip and there’s a lot of Super Mario Brothers imagery around him. Also dreamed that I was sitting next to Demi Moore at some kind of function. I was going an Orlando Bloom impression when she asked me who I was startstruck to see on the LOTR. Answering as Orlando I said Cate Blanchett. Then I leaned over and whispered to her, “Sometimes I’m still star struck when I see you,” and she hit me with a rolled up piece of paper and said, “Oh stop,” in jest.

I also dreamed I was watching the NFL playoffs. The Texans won their playoff game 17-12. A child was rolling around in the mud and I called him a mud honey. I was helping a kid get dressed for picture day and we had to change his diaper. It was so full it leaked onto the rug when his dad and I took it off. 

I also dreamed that I had to meet up with my ex-stepdad and give him a pair of sunglasses he left behind. I thought I wrecked my car on the way back home and I was trying to smooth out the dent, but the next time I saw the car it looked fine.

## Final Thoughts

This dream made me feel very strange and out of sorts. Uncomfortable, even. I'm interested to see if any of these patterns recur over time. Once I have enough of these journals, I will analyze them with the AI tools I have.
