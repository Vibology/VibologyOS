## Events & Encounters
[What happened today - factual record, minimal interpretation]

I overslept for my therapist appointment by about 15 minutes. I got myself put together quickly, grabbed a diet soda, and then was able to meet with my therapist for about an hour. We talked about my synthesis work, what's going good for me, and what things I'm struggling with emotionally right now. After we finished, I took a note that I jotted down upon waking today and transcribed it into my dream journal. Then I began work on my daily journal so I could keep a running tab and not have to update everything at the end of the day. I worked more with the AI this afternoon and then went to do Doordash work around 4:30pm. I dashed until around 9:30pm. Then I got some spicy garlic boneless wings from Buffalo Wild Wings and french fries from McDonalds. Then I came how, put on my Dracula audiobook, and ate while doing more AI work and completing this journal.

## Conditioning Observations
[What "Not-Self" patterns showed up? What external pressures were felt? What did the open centers amplify?]

One of the first things I'm feeling today is the pressure to make money. I'm hoping that tonight's Doordash shift is a good one.

## Questions Arising
[What wants to be understood? What confusion or tension is present?]

Am I actually going to be able to take care of myself financially? Will I be able to stabilize myself enough to achieve my long-term goals?

## Evening Reflection
[End-of-day somatic check-in. How does the body feel after the day's events?]

My back really hurts. I feel an ache in my shoulders. In fact, I feel achy throughout most of my body. My feet are throbbing a little. I might have a little bit of a low-grade headache as well.

## Notes for Synthesis
[Any patterns noticed? Recurring themes? Mark for weekly review.]

The constant tension of not having a steady job. I keep hearing my mother's voice of criticism and disappointment in my mind that I haven't established myself in a career by now. It's something I deal with almost every day.
