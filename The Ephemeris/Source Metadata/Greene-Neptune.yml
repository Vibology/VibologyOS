        pages: "115-119"
        summary: "Examines Attis mythology (son of Cybele, self-castration after betrayal, transformation into pine tree) and Day of Blood rituals.

      - section: "The Christian Symbols"
        pages: "119-120"
        summary: "Introduces Christian symbols as characteristically Neptunian, shared with other redeemer figures. Emphasizes psychological reality of victim-redeemer archetype and dangers of projection in relationships. Frames Christian story as enactment of inner redemptive journey."
      - section: "Virgin Birth"
        pages: "120-123"
        summary: "Analyzes virgin birth as latest parthenogenic creation of oceanic mother, free from Original Sin. Explores infant's fusion with mother, archetypal divine father, and Mary's elevation to goddess status. Discusses Christ's sexual abstinence as fitness to redeem fleshly corruption, and true sacrifice as transformation (making sacred) rather than literal suppression."
      - section: "The Holy Ghost"
        pages: "123-125"
        summary: "Examines Holy Ghost as pneuma (divine breath), comforter, and invisible unifying force between God and humanity. Discusses Gnostic interpretation as Sophia (feminine wisdom) and parallels to Maya, ka-mutef, Orpheus music, and cosmic sea. Describes experience of fusion transcending ego-boundaries accessible through ritual, art, and creative process."
      - section: "The Mass"
        pages: "125-130"
        summary: "Analyzes Mass as ritual invoking Holy Ghost through consumption of consecrated wine/wafers that become Christ's blood/flesh. Explores daipnon vs thysia (sacred meal vs sacrifice), consecration as collective participation mystique, mana in religious relics, and transformation of mundane into redeemer's essence. Extends to addiction (heroin, alcohol, sex, food) as Neptunian consecration seeking redemption through substances."
      - section: "Baptism"
        pages: "130-132"
        summary: "Discusses water as transformative substance of redeemer, Holy Ghost, and oceanic mother. Explores baptism as cleansing from Original Sin, renewal into new life, and water's efficacy against evil. References Wizard of Oz, obsessive handwashing, and Eliot's Waste Land as expressions of water's redemptive power."
      - section: "Crucifixion"
        pages: "132-137"
        summary: "Examines crucifixion as central Christian sacrifice symbol, analogous to Orpheus/Dionysus dismemberment, Mithras-bull slaying, and Attis castration. Analyzes cross as Tree of Life/incarnation, Saturn's glyph (soul imprisoned), and image of voluntary suffering. Distinguishes true sacrifice (offering without hope of return) from bartering with God, exploring Neptune's urge to fuse vs body's separation. Discusses self-imposed crucifixion, martyrdom, and sacrifice as revelation of what must be relinquished: the barter of secret redemption-seeking rather than happiness itself."
      - section: "Suitability for Redeemership"
        pages: "137-138"
        summary: "Introduces three case studies of 20th-century redeemer figures with Sun square Neptune: Meher Baba (Pisces, mystical silence), Billy Graham (Scorpio/Leo, evangelical crusade), and C.G. Jung (Leo/Taurus, collective unconscious and psychological redemption). Notes striking importance of Neptune hard aspects to Sun in those enacting redeemer archetype, whether through conscious choice or devotion of followers."

# SYNTHESIS NOTES
# ==============================================================================
synthesis_notes: |
  Greene's magnum opus on Neptune - comprehensive psychological and mythological
  exploration of the planet of redemption, dissolution, and transcendence.

  **Unique contribution:**
  - Bridges Jungian archetypal psychology with astrological symbolism
  - Extensive mythological foundation (Part One) grounds abstract concepts
  - Addresses moral complexity of Neptunian yearning (not simplistic "spiritual" framing)
  - Explores shadow side: deception, addiction, dissolution, spiritual bypassing
  - Both individual psychology AND collective manifestations (politics, religion, art)
  - Written during Neptune-Uranus conjunction (1990s context)

  **Methodology:**
  - Four-part structure: Mythology → Psychology → Collective → Practical
  - Myth as psyche's self-portrayal (Jungian lens)
  - Integration of religious literature, psychoanalytic theory, and astrology
  - 21 chart examples (historical figures, individuals, nations)
  - "Cookbook" section for practical application (not just theory)

  **Perspective:**
  - Traditional archetypal/psycho-astrology (NOT evolutionary framing)
  - Neptune as dissolver of boundaries, lord of pre-natal waters
  - Redemption as longing for return to primal unity (with all its ambivalence)
  - Moral uncertainty as core Neptunian feature
  - Transcendence and pathology as spectrum, not binary

  **Relationship to other Greene works:**
  - Companion to Saturn (boundary vs. dissolution)
  - Complements The Astrology of Fate (Neptune as fate-dissolver)
  - Part of psychological astrology series (vs. predictive)

  **Best use cases for synthesis:**
  - Neptune placements (sign, house, aspect) - psychological depth
  - Neptune transits - understanding dissolution/transcendence themes
  - Neptune-Saturn dynamics - boundary vs. boundlessness
  - Mythological foundations for Neptunian archetypes
  - Collective Neptune phenomena (political movements, spiritual trends, glamour)
  - Shadow work with Neptunian themes (addiction, deception, victimhood)
  - Cross-system mapping: Neptune → HD Spleen/Solar Plexus themes of boundaries

  **Strengths:**
  - Intellectually rigorous while honoring mystery
  - Avoids New Age platitudes
  - Extensive primary source mythology
  - Psychological nuance (not cookbook simplification)
  - Historical and contemporary examples

  **Limitations:**
  - Dense, scholarly - requires slow reading
  - Assumes familiarity with Jung, Freud, mythology
  - 448 pages - not quick reference
  - Part Four "cookbook" is final section, not standalone
  - Written pre-2000 (cultural references dated)
