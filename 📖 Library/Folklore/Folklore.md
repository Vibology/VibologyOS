*Individual appropriation of cultural archetypal encoding and mythic wisdom.*

## Core Domain

Folklore bridges **Jungian psychology** with esoteric evolution, mapping the [[Collective Unconscious]], archetypal patterns, and the individual's [[Personal Myth]].

## Key Knowledge Areas

### Jungian Framework
- **[[Jungian Archetypes]]** — Universal patterns (Hero, Shadow, Great Mother, Anima/Animus)
- **[[Collective Unconscious]]** — The shared psychic substrate of humanity
- **[[Individuation Process]]** — The journey toward wholeness and Self-realization

### Evolutionary Context
- **[[Three Aeons of Evolution]]** — The Osirian, Horus, and Maat ages
- **[[Seven Root Races]]** — Theosophical evolutionary stages
- **[[The Personal Myth]]** — The unique narrative arc of the individual soul

## Role in [[Vibology]]

Folklore provides the **mythic coordinate**—the archetypal storyline that gives meaning to mechanical data. It transforms charts and gates into a living **narrative** that the psyche can recognize and embody.

Without Folklore, [[Vibology]] becomes mechanistic. With it, the journey becomes **mythopoetic**.
