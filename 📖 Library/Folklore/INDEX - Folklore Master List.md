**Critical Psychological Teachings:**

1. **Predator vs. Shadow Distinction:**
   - Redeemable positive shadow (Beast, Frog) - integrate through love or confrontation
   - Unredeemable predator (Bluebeard, Robber Bridegroom) - sever, escape, slay
   - Critical for domestic violence awareness, boundary work, discernment

2. **Two Transformation Pathways:**
   - Beauty's tears (Albedo, Strength, ages 18-25) - acceptance, devotion, tender love
   - Frog Prince rage (Nigredo, Tower, ages 12-16) - shock, crisis, passionate confrontation
   - Not all transformation is gentle; timing and developmental stage determine pathway

3. **Developmental Staging:**
   - Ages 4-8: Hansel/Gretel (separation from mother)
   - Ages 8-12: Youngest Child (valuing despised parts)
   - Ages 12-16: Frog Prince, Snow White (puberty transformation)
   - Ages 16-25: Beauty/Beast, Cinderella, Rapunzel (Sacred Marriage, autonomy)
   - Ages 25-40: Bluebeard (predator recognition), Two Brothers (shadow integration)
   - Ages 40+: Spinning/Weaving, Death/Resurrection (fate acceptance, Life/Death/Life)

4. **Feminine Initiation Mysteries:**
   - Vasilisa's doll (homunculus, La Que Sabe, ancestral wisdom)
   - Baba Yaga's tasks (Terrible Mother initiation, impossible demands, fiery skull vision)
   - Spinning/weaving (manifestation, creating reality through patient work)
   - Tower imprisonment (breaking symbiotic mother bond through exile)
   - Forbidden chamber (indelible knowledge, seeing the carnage, consciousness irreversible)

5. **Masculine Initiation Mysteries:**
   - Three trials (patience over intellect, animal helpers, grounding spiritual goals)
   - Quest object (Self as dragon-guarded treasure, leaving comfort zone)
   - Youngest child (Fool's wisdom, inferior function as bridge to unconscious)
   - Two brothers (Ego-Shadow interdependence, light cannot survive without dark)

**What This Complete Framework Provides:**

- **Teaching Demonstrations:** Narrative examples for abstract Jungian concepts

*"The personal unconscious rests upon a deeper layer, which does not derive from personal experience and is not a personal acquisition but is inborn. This deeper layer I call the collective unconscious. I have chosen the term 'collective' because this part of the unconscious is not individual but universal; in contrast to the personal psyche, it has contents and modes of behavior that are more or less the same everywhere and in all individuals."*

— C.G. Jung, *The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious* (CW 9i, para. 3)
