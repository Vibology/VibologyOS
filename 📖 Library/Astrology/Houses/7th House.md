# 7th House: Partnership and the Mirror of Relationship

## Archetypal Theme

The **7th House** is the **Descendant**—the western horizon, where the Sun sets. This is the house of **partnership**: marriage, open enemies, contracts, and all relationships that function as mirrors. The 7th reveals what you project onto the "other."

## Life Domain

- Marriage and committed partnership
- Open enemies and legal disputes
- Contracts and formal agreements
- Cooperation and negotiation

## Natural Correspondence

**[[Libra]]** and **[[Venus]]** — The balancer, the principle of equilibrium through relationship.

**Cosignificator:** [[Moon]] (emotional attunement, receptivity)

## Psychological Function

The 7th House is the **projection screen**—the qualities you deny in yourself and seek in others. A strong 7th creates mutuality; an afflicted 7th alternates between fusion and hostility, never finding the "I-Thou" balance.

## Invitation

Who are you when no one is watching—and is that different from who you are in relationship?
