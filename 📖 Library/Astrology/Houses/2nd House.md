# 2nd House: Resources and the Ground of Worth

## Archetypal Theme

The **2nd House** governs **material resources**—not wealth for its own sake, but the embodied support that sustains life. This is the house of what you *value*, what you accumulate, what you trust to nourish you.

## Life Domain

- Movable goods, money, possessions
- Self-worth and the capacity to receive
- Physical senses and embodied pleasure
- Earning capacity and resourcefulness

## Natural Correspondence

**[[Taurus]]** and **[[Venus]]** — The builder, the principle of consolidation and sensory richness.

**Cosignificator:** [[Jupiter]] (expansion, benevolence)

## Psychological Function

The 2nd House reveals **what you believe you deserve**. It is not about what you have, but what you allow yourself to *receive*. A well-supported 2nd House knows its worth without external validation; an afflicted 2nd either hoards from fear or rejects abundance from unworthiness.

## Invitation

What do you *actually* value—and does your life reflect that, or are you accumulating what you were told to want?

*"The 2nd House is the soil. What you plant there determines what you harvest."*
