# 10th House: Vocation and the Peak of Worldly Estimation

## Archetypal Theme

The **10th House** is the **Midheaven** (MC)—the highest point in the chart, visible to all. This is the house of **vocation**: not career (that's 6th), but *calling*—the work the world recognizes as yours. It governs reputation, public authority, and the mother (as the first authority figure).

## Life Domain

- Vocation and public role
- Reputation and worldly estimation
- Mother and authority figures
- Honors, rank, and social standing

## Natural Correspondence

**[[Capricorn]]** and **[[Saturn]]** — The elder, the principle of mastery through sustained effort.

**Cosignificator:** [[Mars]] (the drive to achieve, the ambition to ascend)

## Psychological Function

The 10th House reveals **what you are here to build**—not for personal gain, but as contribution to the collective. A strong 10th earns authority through competence; an afflicted 10th either collapses under pressure or becomes the tyrant.

## Invitation

What are you building—and will it survive your death?

*"The 10th House is the peak. The view is magnificent—but the descent is inevitable."*
