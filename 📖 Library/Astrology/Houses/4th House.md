# 4th House: Roots and the Foundation of Being

## Archetypal Theme

The **4th House** is the **Imum Coeli** (IC)—the lowest point in the chart, the hidden foundation. This is the house of **ancestry**, home, and the private self that exists before the world imposes its demands. It represents the father (traditionally), the land, and the emotional bedrock.

## Life Domain

- Home and domestic environment
- Father and patrilineal ancestry
- Emotional foundation and sense of belonging
- End of life (the final return home)

## Natural Correspondence

**[[Cancer]]** and **[[Moon]]** — The mother archetype, nurturance, the womb.

**Cosignificator:** [[Sun]] (the father, authority)

## Psychological Function

The 4th House is the **unconscious matrix**—the family patterns, the ancestral memory, the soil from which identity grows. A strong 4th provides emotional safety; an afflicted 4th creates rootlessness or enmeshment.

## Invitation

Where do you come from—and are you still living in that story, or have you claimed your own ground?
