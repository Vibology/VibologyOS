# 6th House: Service and the Sacred in the Mundane

## Archetypal Theme

The **6th House** governs **daily work**—not vocation (10th), but the unglamorous labor of maintenance. This is the house of health, servants, small animals, and the discipline of showing up when inspiration has fled. It is Virgo's domain: refinement through repetition.

## Life Domain

- Health and illness
- Daily routines and work habits
- Service and employees
- Pets and small animals

## Natural Correspondence

**[[Virgo]]** and **[[Mercury]]** — The investigator, the principle of discernment.

**Planetary Joy:** [[Mars]] (despite the house's reputation as unfortunate—Mars here is the warrior refined into craftsman)

## Psychological Function

The 6th House reveals **how you serve**—and whether that service nourishes or depletes. A strong 6th finds meaning in care; an afflicted 6th collapses into martyrdom or escapes into neglect.

## Invitation

What would change if you treated your daily work as a spiritual practice?
