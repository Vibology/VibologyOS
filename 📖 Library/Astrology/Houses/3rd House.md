# 3rd House: Communication and the Local Network

## Archetypal Theme

The **3rd House** governs **communication**—not just speech, but the entire network of local exchange. This is the house of siblings, neighbors, short journeys, and the immediate environment that shapes the early mind.

## Life Domain

- Siblings and early peer relationships
- Communication style and mental patterns
- Short trips and local environment
- Primary education and early learning

## Natural Correspondence

**[[Gemini]]** and **[[Mercury]]** — The messenger, the principle of exchange and distribution.

**Planetary Joy:** [[Moon]] (instinctual knowing, the second brain)

## Psychological Function

The 3rd House reveals **how you think**—not what you think (that's the 9th), but the *pattern* of your cognition. It is the local network, the immediate connections that form the substrate of consciousness.

## Invitation

How do you speak—and does your language create connection or distance?

*"The 3rd House is the network. The quality of your connections determines the quality of your information."*
