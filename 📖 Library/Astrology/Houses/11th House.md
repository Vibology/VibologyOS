# 11th House: Friendship, Hope, and the Collective Vision

## Archetypal Theme

The **11th House** governs **friendship** and **collective belonging**—not tribe (4th), but chosen community. This is the house of hope, future vision, and the networks that transcend individual ego. It is [[Aquarius]]'s domain: the recognition that individuality serves the whole.

## Life Domain

- Friendships and chosen community
- Hopes, wishes, and future aspirations
- Group affiliations and social networks
- Humanitarian vision and collective projects

## Natural Correspondence

**[[Aquarius]]** and **[[Uranus]]/[[Saturn]]** — The humanitarian, the revolutionary architect.

**Planetary Joy:** [[Jupiter]] (faith, trust, benevolent expansion)

## Psychological Function

The 11th House reveals **what you hope for**—not personal desire (5th), but the vision you carry for the collective. A strong 11th builds networks of mutual support; an afflicted 11th either isolates or loses self in abstract ideals.

## Invitation

What future are you building—and who is building it with you?
