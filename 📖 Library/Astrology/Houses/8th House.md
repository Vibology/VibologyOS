# 8th House: Death, Transformation, and the Underworld

## Archetypal Theme

The **8th House** governs **death and rebirth**—not physical death alone, but all processes of transformation that require ego-death. This is the house of inheritance, shared resources, sexuality, and the psychological infrastructure beneath social performance. It is [[Scorpio]]'s domain: the relentless excavation of truth.

## Life Domain

- Death and inheritance
- Shared resources and debt
- Sexuality and psycholog ical intimacy
- Occult knowledge and hidden matters

## Natural Correspondence

**[[Scorpio]]** and **[[Pluto]]/[[Mars]]** — The transformer, the underworld lord.

**Cosignificator:** [[Saturn]] (consequence, the harvester)

## Psychological Function

The 8th House is **Shadow territory**—the buried trauma, the disowned power, the parts of self exiled into the unconscious. A strong 8th transmutes pain into wisdom; an afflicted 8th cycles through compulsion, control, and collapse.

## Invitation

What have you buried—and what will it cost if it remains underground?
