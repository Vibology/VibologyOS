## The Twelve Houses (12 entries)

**Completion:** 12/12 houses present, but **ALL ARE STUBS** (0% developed)

### Angular Houses (4 entries) — 🔴 All Stubs

| House | Angle | Theme | Natural Sign | Status | Link |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------|--------|------|

| 10th House | Midheaven | Career, Authority | Capricorn | 🔴 Stub (Tier 0-1, 41 lines) | [[10th House]] |

### Succedent Houses (4 entries) — 🔴 All Stubs

| House | Theme | Natural Sign | Status | Link |
|-------|-------|--------------|--------|------|
| 2nd House | Resources, Values | Taurus | 🔴 Stub (Tier 0-1, 41 lines) | [[2nd House]] |
| 5th House | Creativity, Play | Leo | 🔴 Stub (Tier 0-1, 41 lines) | [[5th House]] |
| 8th House | Death, Transformation | Scorpio | 🔴 Stub (Tier 0-1, 41 lines) | [[8th House]] |
| 11th House | Community, Ideals | Aquarius | 🔴 Stub (Tier 0-1, 41 lines) | [[11th House]] |

### Cadent Houses (4 entries) — 🔴 All Stubs

| House | Theme | Natural Sign | Status | Link |
|-------|-------|--------------|--------|------|
| 3rd House | Communication, Learning | Gemini | 🔴 Stub (Tier 0-1, 41 lines) | [[3rd House]] |
| 6th House | Service, Health | Virgo | 🔴 Stub (Tier 0-1, 41 lines) | [[6th House]] |
| 9th House | Philosophy, Travel | Sagittarius | 🔴 Stub (Tier 0-1, 41 lines) | [[9th House]] |
| 12th House | Dissolution, Hidden | Pisces | 🔴 Stub (Tier 0-1, 41 lines) | [[12th House]] |

**House Categories:**
- **Angular Houses (4):** 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th — Cardinal energy, most powerful, represent identity, home, relationships, career
- **Succedent Houses (4):** 2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th — Fixed energy, sustaining, represent resources, creativity, transformation, community
- **Cadent Houses (4):** 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th — Mutable energy, transitional, represent communication, service, philosophy, spirituality

**CRITICAL ISSUE:**
All 12 House entries are identical 41-line stubs containing only:
- Archetypal Theme (1 paragraph)
- Life Domain (bulleted list)
- Natural Correspondence (1 line)
- Psychological Function (1 paragraph)
- Invitation (1 sentence)
- Closing quote

**Missing sections (for Tier 2 minimum):**
- Angular/Succedent/Cadent classification and significance
- Planetary rulers and significations
- Planets through Houses (e.g., Sun in 1st vs. Sun in 12th)
- House cusps and interceptions
- Derivative houses (e.g., 2nd from 2nd, 8th from 7th)
- Evolved vs. unevolved expressions
- Practical examples and case studies

**Priority:** **HIGH** — This is the most critical gap in the Astrology pillar. Houses are fundamental to chart interpretation and cannot remain stubs.

**Target:** Expand all 12 Houses to Tier 2 standard (120-150 lines each)

*"Astrology is the language of time—the syntax by which cosmic forces speak to embodied consciousness. The chart is not prediction but revelation: the blueprint of potentials waiting to be chosen, ignored, or transcended. To read the sky is to read the soul, and to honor the transits is to trust that becoming has its own geometry."*
