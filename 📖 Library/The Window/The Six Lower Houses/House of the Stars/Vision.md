# Vision

*The creative soul that sees beauty in possibilities*

---

## Card Symbolism & Meaning

Vision represents the gift of **creative perception that sees fresh possibilities**—the soul's capacity to envision what has not yet manifested, to transform entropy into beauty through visionary awareness. This is the positive pole of Stars' spectrum, where mastery begins with **vision that perceives potential** before it exists.

In The Window system, Vision is the archetype of creative foresight built from fresh perception. This is not vision as fantasy but vision as **the soul's capacity to see what could be**, to perceive beauty in raw potential. When Vision appears, it signals mastery that begins with creative sight.

The card draws from Gate 1's mechanical function—the G Center's creative force—and elevates it within Stars' domain. Where Gate 1 mechanically represents creative initiative, **Vision speaks Stars' gift**: "I see what could be. My perception transforms entropy into possibility. My vision creates beauty."
