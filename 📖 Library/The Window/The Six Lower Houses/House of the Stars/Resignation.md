# Resignation

*The limited soul that accepts defeat prematurely*

---

## Card Symbolism & Meaning

Resignation represents the shadow of **mastery abandoned through perceived limitation**—the soul's capacity for realism corrupted into premature surrender, achievement degraded into resignation before justice is achieved. This is the negative pole of Stars' spectrum, where mastery stops because **limitation is accepted as permanent**.

In The Window system, Resignation is the archetype of abandoned mastery built from false limitation. This is not resignation as acceptance but resignation as **the soul's premature surrender** to obstacles that could be overcome. When Resignation appears, it signals mastery abandoned too soon.

The card draws from Gate 60's mechanical function—the Root Center's limitation and acceptance—and inverts it within Stars' domain. Where Gate 60 in its gift accepts realistic limits to achieve justice, **Resignation speaks Stars' shadow**: "I cannot continue. Limitation prevents mastery. I accept defeat before achieving justice."
