# Pride

*The self-obsessed soul that mistakes accomplishment for identity*

---

## Card Symbolism & Meaning

Pride represents the shadow of **material achievement corrupted into ego-inflation**—the soul's capacity for mastery perverted into self-obsession, excellence degraded into vanity. This is the negative pole of Stars' spectrum, where achievement becomes **pride that separates rather than naturalness that integrates**.

In The Window system, Pride is the archetype of corrupted mastery built from self-obsession. This is not pride as healthy self-esteem but pride as **the soul's identification with accomplishment**, mistaking what one has achieved for who one is. When Pride appears, it signals mastery corrupted by ego.

The card draws from Gate 10's mechanical function—the G Center's behavior and self-love—and inverts it within Stars' domain. Where Gate 10 in its gift expresses natural being, **Pride speaks Stars' shadow**: "I am my accomplishments. My achievements define my worth. My mastery inflates my ego."
