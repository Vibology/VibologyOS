# Stagnation

*The vain soul frozen by discrimination*

---

## Card Symbolism & Meaning

Stagnation represents the shadow of **mastery paralyzed by excessive discrimination**—the soul's capacity for discernment corrupted into vanity that prevents action, excellence degraded into stagnation through over-refinement. This is the negative pole of Stars' spectrum, where achievement stops because **nothing is ever good enough**.

In The Window system, Stagnation is the archetype of paralyzed mastery built from vain discrimination. This is not stagnation as rest but stagnation as **the soul's inability to act** because judgment has become excessive. When Stagnation appears, it signals mastery frozen by perfectionism.

The card draws from Gate 12's mechanical function—the Throat Center's standstill and caution—and inverts it within Stars' domain. Where Gate 12 in its gift discriminates to purify, **Stagnation speaks Stars' shadow**: "Nothing is good enough. My discrimination prevents action. My refinement creates paralysis."
