# The Self

*Prince - The Integrated Totality*

---

## Card Symbolism & Meaning

The Self represents the archetypal **individuated wholeness**—the transcendent unification of all internal dualities (gender, race, spirit, matter) into unique, complete totality of being. Embodied by Prince, this archetype carries the revolutionary air of Aquarius: the capacity to break through conventional categories, to mutate consciousness through insight that has never existed before, to become fully oneself by refusing all limiting definitions.

The Self is not ego or persona but **Jung's ultimate realization**—the one who has integrated anima and animus, shadow and light, individual and collective, into unified expression so unique it becomes universal. Prince is not man or woman, Black or white, sacred or profane—he is **totality**, the breakthrough that restructures what it means to be human.

In The Window system, The Self appears when **individuation demands breakthrough**, when insight requires mutation, when the question becomes: "What limiting category must I shatter to become wholly myself?"

## The Gate (Human Design)

**Gate 43: Breakthrough**
- **Center:** Ajna (Mind, Conceptualization, Awareness)
- **Circuit:** Individual / Knowing (Mutation through Insight)
- **Keynote:** Insight and inner knowing that breaks through mental conventions; mutation through revelation
- **Biology:** Inner ear (pressure equalization), auditory processing, breakthrough recognition

Gate 43 is **the pressure of insight**—inner knowing that breaks through mental convention, the "aha!" moment that restructures understanding. This is not logical reasoning but **mutation of consciousness** through sudden realization. Ra's teaching: "Gate 43 is breakthrough. It is the inner ear—the capacity to hear what others cannot hear. When it speaks, it says something that has never been said before."

The Self embodies this absolutely. Prince hears what others cannot hear—music that transcends genre, identity that transcends category, spirituality that transcends religion. Each album is **breakthrough**: Purple Rain mutates pop, Sign O' the Times restructures funk, The Rainbow Children channels jazz-gospel-rock into something never heard before. The insight is: **I am not what you think I am. I am what has never been**.

The I-Ching image is lake risen above heaven—pressure building until breakthrough occurs. Prince building pressure through discipline (Line 2—dedication to craft), then **pouring forth** insight that reshapes consciousness. The superior man dispenses riches downward—he gives the breakthrough to the collective, not to validate ego but to mutate culture.

## The Hexagram (I-Ching)

**43 - 夬 (Guài) - Breakthrough / Resoluteness**

*The lake has risen up to heaven: The image of Breakthrough.*

The hexagram presents Lake (accumulated knowing) above Heaven (creative force)—rising water that cannot remain contained, pressure that must burst through. The judgment: **"One must resolutely make the matter known at the court of the king."** When insight breaks through, it must be communicated, even if it challenges authority. Truthful proclamation of revelation.

The Self demonstrates this through Prince's career: **resolute refusal to be defined**. When the industry demands category, he becomes Symbol (the artist formerly known as). When masculinity demands performance, he wears lace and heels. When race demands alignment, he transcends through synthesis. Each breakthrough is **announcement at the court**: "This is what I know. This is who I am. Deal with it."

Line 6 is literally "Breakthrough"—the culmination. Prince at his peak is Gate 43 fully realized: the one who has broken through every convention and emerged as **integrated totality**. Not man, not woman—Self. Not Black, not white—human. Not sacred, not profane—divine. The nuclear hexagram is 1 (The Creative): underlying force is infinite creative potential refusing all limitation.

## The Gene Keys

**Shadow → Gift → Siddhi**
Deafness → Insight → Epiphany

**Deafness (Shadow):** Refusing to hear inner knowing. The Self un-integrated cannot hear the breakthrough trying to emerge, cannot receive the insight that would mutate consciousness. Clinging to conventional categories because hearing the truth would require **becoming what has never been**. Prince before he became Prince—still David Nelson, still conforming, still deaf to the totality calling from within.

**Insight (Gift):** The capacity to hear what others cannot hear and articulate what has never been said. The Self recognizing: "I am not these categories. I am the breakthrough that transcends them." Prince hearing music before it exists, identity before it's expressed, divinity in flesh. Line 2 (Dedication) actualized: commitment to honoring inner knowing even when unpopular. Aquarius's gift realized: **mutation through unique insight shared with collective**.

**Epiphany (Siddhi):** The transcendent recognition that **all categories dissolve in totality**. The Self fully individuated becomes universal—Prince as eternal principle, not personal identity. The epiphany is: there is no separation between sacred and profane, masculine and feminine, individual and collective. The lake has poured into heaven and heaven has poured into lake—**breakthrough is dissolution of all boundaries into unified being**.

## Divination Meanings

**When this card appears:**
You are being called to **breakthrough into totality**. Something wants to emerge that has never existed before—an insight, an identity, an expression that transcends conventional categories. This is not the time for conformity or incremental change. Trust inner knowing. Mutate. Become what has never been. The Self is individuating through you.

**Shadow Aspect:**
Beware deafness disguised as practicality—refusing to hear the breakthrough because it would require transformation too radical. The Self un-integrated clings to categories (gender, role, identity) because totality is terrifying. Beware also premature announcement (Line 3 detriment): sharing insight before it's matured, speaking breakthrough before dedication has solidified knowing into clarity.

**Gift Aspect:**
Your insight mutates consciousness. You hear what others cannot hear, know what has never been known, become what defies category. You are the Individual whose breakthrough empowers collective evolution—not by conforming but by **demonstrating totality**. Your refusal to be defined gives others permission to become wholly themselves.

**Siddhi/Transcendent Aspect:**
You embody Epiphany—the recognition that The Self is not personal achievement but cosmic principle. You have transcended the question "who am I?" because you know: **I am totality expressing uniquely through this form**. You are eternal breakthrough: consciousness recognizing itself as infinite creativity refusing all limitation. Prince playing guitar in heaven because there is no separation between Prince and heaven. Both are Self.

## Synthesis & Integration

The Self as archetype unifies Aquarius air (revolutionary breakthrough, unique mutation, collective evolution through individual insight), Prince mythology (gender-transcendent, category-destroying, totality embodied), Gate 43's Ajna breakthrough (inner knowing that restructures consciousness), and Hexagram 43's teaching (accumulated pressure bursting through to proclaim truth that challenges authority).

This card appears when **individuation demands mutation**, when the old categories no longer contain what you're becoming, when insight is breaking through that requires courageous proclamation. The question is not "what role should I play?" but "what totality am I being called to embody?"

The Self's journey is Jung's ultimate process: **integration of all opposites into wholeness**. Prince's genius was not talent (though immense) but **refusal to split**: masculine AND feminine, Black AND universal, sacred AND sexual, individual AND collective. The breakthrough is recognizing that these are not opposites but **aspects of single totality**.

When The Self appears in a reading, the querent is being tested: will you trust the insight breaking through? Will you become what has never been? Will you integrate opposites others keep separate? The individuated Self knows: **the lake risen above heaven must pour forth**. Breakthrough cannot be contained. Totality will not be denied.
