# Angelology Overview

**Pillar 1 of 7** — Hierarchical consciousness patterns and divine emanation.

## Core Domain

Angelology maps the **nine orders of angels** as consciousness hierarchies, bridging divine emanation with human mechanical structure.

## Key Knowledge Areas

### [[Nine Orders of Angels]]
1. **Seraphim** — Highest order; pure divine contemplation
2. **Cherubim** — Knowledge and wisdom
3. **Thrones** — Divine justice and authority
4. **Dominations** — Regulation of angelic duties
5. **Powers** — Cosmic order and opposition to chaos
6. **Virtues** — Miracles and blessings
7. **Principalities** — Nations and collective guidance
8. **Archangels** — Messengers of important decrees
9. **Angels** — Direct human interaction

### Integration with [[Human Design]]

The nine orders map to the **nine energy centers** of the BodyGraph:

- [[Hierarchical Consciousness Patterns]]

## Role in [[Vibology]]

Angelology provides the **vertical hierarchical structure** of consciousness, showing how divine intelligence emanates through progressively denser forms until reaching the individual human vehicle.
