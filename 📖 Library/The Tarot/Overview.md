# Tarot Overview

**Pillar 6 of 7** — Qabalistic pathways and archetypal progression.

## Core Domain

Tarot maps the **Tree of Life**—the Qabalistic structure of creation—through 78 archetypal symbols, revealing the soul's journey across the ten Sephiroth and twenty-two Paths.

## Key Knowledge Areas

### The Arcana
- **[[Major Arcana]]** — 22 trump cards; the "legend of the soul"
- **[[Minor Arcana]]** — 56 cards across four suits (Wands, Cups, Swords, Pentacles)

### Qabalistic Structure
- **[[Tree of Life]]** — Ten Sephiroth and twenty-two Paths
- **[[The Ten Sephiroth]]** — Emanations from Kether to Malkuth
- **[[The Twenty-Two Paths]]** — Connective channels and Hebrew letters
- **[[Hebrew Letters]]** — Maternals, Doubles, and Simples

### Practice
- **[[Spreads]]** — Celtic Cross, Tree of Life Spread, and custom layouts
- **[[Qabalistic Pathworking]]** — Visionary journey along the Paths
- **[[The Legend of the Soul]]** — The Major Arcana as initiatory sequence

## Role in [[Vibology]]

Tarot provides the **initiatory coordinate**—the pathways of ascent and descent mapped onto consciousness. When cross-referenced with [[Human Design]]'s 64 gates, the 22 Paths reveal connective tissue between mechanical activation and archetypal progression.
