## Cross-References

**Tarot connects to other systems via:**

### Astrology
- **Minor Arcana Pips:** Each numbered card (2-10) corresponds to a planetary decan
  - See [[Astrology]] for planet dignities and decan system
- **Major Arcana:** Planetary and zodiacal attributions
  - Example: [[0 - The Fool]] = Uranus/Air, [[1 - The Magician]] = Mercury

### Qabalah / The Window
- **Sephiroth:** Each numbered card corresponds to one of the ten Sephiroth
  - Aces = [[Kether]], Twos = [[Chokmah]], Threes = [[Binah]], etc.
- **Tree of Life Paths:** Major Arcana correspond to the 22 paths between Sephiroth
  - See `📖 Library/The Tarot/Tree of Life/` for mapping
- **Four Worlds:** Suits = Qabalistic Worlds (Wands=Atziluth, Cups=Briah, Swords=Yetzirah, Pentacles=Assiah)

### Jungian Psychology
- **Archetypes:** Major Arcana embody Jungian archetypes
  - [[The Shadow]] (Devil, Moon), [[Anima/Animus]] (High Priestess/Emperor), [[The Self]] (World)
  - See [[Folklore]] for Jungian archetypal analysis

### Human Design
- **Thematic resonance:** Not direct 1:1 mapping, but archetypal parallels
  - Example: King of Wands (Fire of Fire, visionary command) resonates with [[Manifestor]] Type energy

### I-Ching / The Window
- **The 64 Patterns:** Potential mapping to Minor Arcana combinations (future work)
- See `📖 Library/The Window/The 64 Patterns/`
