  - Example: [[0 - The Fool]] = Uranus/Air, [[1 - The Magician]] = Mercury

### Qabalah / The Window

  - Aces = [[Kether]], Twos = [[Chokmah]], Threes = [[Binah]], etc.
- **Tree of Life Paths:** Major Arcana correspond to the 22 paths between Sephiroth
  - See `📖 Library/The Tarot/Tree of Life/` for mapping
- **Four Worlds:** Suits = Qabalistic Worlds (Wands=Atziluth, Cups=Briah, Swords=Yetzirah, Pentacles=Assiah)
