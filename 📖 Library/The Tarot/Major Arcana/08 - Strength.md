# 8 - Strength: Fortitude and the Taming of the Beast

## Archetypal Essence

Strength is not brute force but **mastery through love**. The card depicts a woman gently closing the jaws of a lion—not through violence, but through presence, through the solar force that tames animal potency without destroying it.

This is Daniel in the lion's den, [[Mithra]] subduing the bull. Strength teaches that the greatest power is *self-control*—the conscious direction of Kundalini, the serpent fire.

## Qabalistic Path

**Path 19: Chesed (Mercy) → Geburah (Severity)**

Strength balances Mercy and Severity—tempering raw force with compassion. She does not destroy the lion; she *gentles* it, demonstrating that true strength is the capacity to *not* use force when force is available.

## Hebrew Letter: Teth (ט)

**Teth** means "serpent"—the primal life force, the Kundalini that rises through the spine. Strength is the conscious awakening and direction of this energy.

## Astrological Attribution

**[[Leo]]** — The principle of solar vitality, courage, and the heart's authority. Strength is Leo at its highest: not dominance, but self-possession.

## Divinatory Meaning

**Upright:** Courage, action, fortitude. The capacity to face fear without being consumed by it. Mastery of the instinctual nature.

Strength appears when you are being tested—not by external enemies, but by your own animal drives. She signals: *You are stronger than your fear.*

## Psychological & Jungian Depth

Strength represents the **integration of the Shadow**—not through repression, but through relationship. The lion is the instinctual self: rage, lust, hunger. Strength does not deny these—she *befriends* them, directing their energy toward higher purpose.

Shadow Strength:
- Over-control of instinct (the lion caged, not tamed)
- Spiritual bypassing (using "love" to avoid confrontation)
- Martyrdom (endurance as self-punishment)

## Invitation for Contemplation

What part of yourself are you trying to *kill*—and what would happen if you learned to *tame* it instead? The lion does not need to die. It needs a worthy master.

*"Strength does not conquer the beast. She loves it into submission."*
