# 10 - Wheel of Fortune: Conciliation and the Mastery of Cycles

## Archetypal Essence

The Wheel of Fortune is the principle of **cyclical time**—the recognition that all rise is followed by fall, all fall by rise. The Sphinx sits atop the Wheel, calm amidst the turning, while figures rise and fall on its circumference.

The Wheel teaches that "fortune" is not random but **patterned**—and those who understand the pattern can navigate the cycles rather than being swept by them.

## Qabalistic Path

**Path 21: Chesed (Mercy) → Netzach (Victory)**

The Wheel connects Mercy with Victory, teaching that success comes not through force but through *alignment with rhythm*. The Wheel is the "Forces of Life"—the four elements that must be mastered to achieve stability.

## Hebrew Letter: Caph (כ)

**Caph** means "palm" or "grasp"—the hand that holds, that directs, that shapes fate rather than submitting to it.

## Astrological Attribution

**[[Jupiter]]** — The principle of expansion, benevolence, and karmic law. The Wheel is Jupiter's teaching: what you give, you receive—multiplied.

## Divinatory Meaning

**Upright:** Good fortune, karma, the end of "chance." The recognition that what appears as luck is actually consequence.

The Wheel appears when the cycle is turning in your favor—but also as reminder that the turn will come again. She signals: *Enjoy the rise, but do not cling. Endure the fall, but do not despair.*

## Psychological & Jungian Depth

The Wheel represents the **[[Self]] as the still point**—the center that does not turn, the awareness that witnesses the rise and fall of fortune without identifying with either.

Shadow Wheel:
- Fatalism (surrendering agency to "fate")
- Hubris (believing the rise will last forever)
- Bitterness (blaming the universe when the Wheel turns)

## Invitation for Contemplation

What are you clinging to as "permanent"—and can you love it knowing it will pass? The Wheel does not stop. The question is whether you ride it or resist it.

*"The Wheel of Fortune does not favor the virtuous. It turns for all—but only the wise learn to dance with the turning."*
