# Inner Authority and Strategy

The mechanism by which the [[Anima]] validates what the [[Algorithm|Anima et Algorithm]] presents.

## Inner Authority

Your unique decision-making mechanism that tests truth against your body's resonance:
- **Sacral:** Gut response (uh-huh / uhn-uhn)
- **Emotional:** Clarity through the wave
- **Splenic:** Instantaneous survival intuition
- **Ego:** Will and commitment ("What's in it for me?")
- **Self-Projected:** Truth revealed through speaking
- **Mental/Environmental:** Sounding boards in correct environment

## Strategy

The navigational approach aligned with your [[Human Design]] Type:
- **Manifestor:** Inform before initiating
- **Generator:** Wait to respond
- **Projector:** Wait for invitation
- **Reflector:** Wait a lunar cycle

## The Role in Vibology

Authority and Strategy ensure:
- The Algorithm's data is tested by lived experience
- Knowledge becomes **Syn-Gnosis** (synthesized knowing)
- You stand as your own sovereign navigator

Without Inner Authority, the map becomes dogma.
