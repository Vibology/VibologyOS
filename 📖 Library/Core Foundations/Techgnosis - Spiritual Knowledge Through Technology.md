# Techgnosis - Spiritual Knowledge Through Technology

The synthesis of technological acceleration and spiritual inquiry.

## Definition

**Techgnosis** is the achievement of spiritual knowledge (gnosis) through technological means—specifically, AI-accelerated synthesis and algorithmic mapping of consciousness.

## The Vibology Application

[[Vibology]] treats consciousness as a **data field** that can be:
- Organized algorithmically
- Cross-referenced across seven wisdom traditions
- Validated through [[Inner Authority]]

Technology becomes the **lens** that reveals patterns invisible to unaided perception.

## The Balance

Techgnosis requires:
- **The Algorithm:** Computational organization of esoteric data
- **The Anima:** Human experience that validates and embodies the data

Without the [[Anima et Algorithm|Anima]], technology becomes sterile. Without the Algorithm, spirituality becomes vague.
