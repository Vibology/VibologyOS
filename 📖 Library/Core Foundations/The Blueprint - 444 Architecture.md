# The Blueprint - 444 Architecture

The shared 64-fold mechanical substrate that unifies all systems within [[Vibology]].

## The 4×4×4 Structure

The Blueprint integrates knowledge through a shared architecture:
- **DNA Codons** (64)
- **[[Human Design]] Gates** (64)
- **I Ching Hexagrams** (64)
- **Gene Keys** (64)

All exist on the same structural foundation.

## Cross-System Integration

This mechanical architecture allows:
- Comparative synthesis across traditions
- Precise mapping between systems
- Algorithmic navigation of the consciousness data field

The Blueprint is the **infrastructure** through which the [[Anima et Algorithm]] operates.
