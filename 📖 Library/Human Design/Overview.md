# Human Design Overview

**Pillar 4 of 7** — Individual genetic imprinting and mechanical navigation.

## Core Domain

Human Design reveals the **mechanical blueprint** of the individual—the genetic imprinting received at birth through the neutrino stream, mapped onto the [[The Rave BodyGraph|BodyGraph]].

## Key Knowledge Areas

### Fundamental Mechanics
- **[[Types]]** — Manifestor, Generator, Projector, Reflector
- **[[Strategy and Authority]]** — How to navigate and decide correctly
- **[[Centers]]** — Nine energy hubs (defined vs. undefined)
- **[[Channels]]** — 36 connections between centers
- **[[Gates]]** — 64 genetic expressions
- **[[Profiles]]** — 12 archetypal life themes

### Deep Structure
- **[[Substructure]]** — Base, Tone, Color (the "Actor Beneath the Line")
- **[[The Rave BodyGraph]]** — The visual synthesis of all mechanics

## Role in [[Vibology]]

Human Design is the **individual coordinate**—the precise mechanical differentiation that distinguishes you from the collective. It anchors [[The Blueprint - 444 Architecture|the 64-fold architecture]] in your specific body.

When integrated with [[The Window]], Human Design reveals both the **timeless gate** and its **contemporary face**.
