## The 36 Channels (0/36 entries)

**Completion:** 0/36 (0%) - Planned for future expansion

**Channels Overview:**
- 36 total channels connecting Centers in the BodyGraph
- Each channel represents a specific life force/theme when activated (both gates defined)
- Channels determine Type (e.g., Sacral-Throat channel = Manifesting Generator)

**Planned Structure:**
- Channel entries will include: Gate-to-Gate mapping, Center connection, Type implications, archetypal theme, circuit membership, cross-references
- Estimated expansion: 36 entries × ~150-200 lines each

**Priority:** Low (core mechanics complete without Channels; requires Gates foundation first)

**Channel Categories:**
- **Individual Circuitry:** Empowerment, knowing
- **Tribal Circuitry:** Support, community
- **Collective Circuitry:** Sharing, logic

---

## Substructure / Advanced Mechanics (0 entries)

**Completion:** 0/? (0%) - Planned for future expansion

**Substructure Overview:**
- Advanced Human Design mechanics beneath the BodyGraph surface
- Includes: Variable (PHS/Environment), Tone, Base, Color
- Highly specialized knowledge for advanced practitioners

**Planned Entries:**
- Variable (Determination, Environment, Perspective, Motivation)
- Tone & Base mechanics
- Color theory (dietary regimen, cognition, environment)

**Priority:** Low (specialized knowledge; core mechanics serve 95% of use cases)

---

## Cross-References

**Human Design connects to other systems via:**

### I-Ching / The Window
- **The 64 Gates:** Each HD gate corresponds to one I-Ching hexagram
  - Gate 1 = Hexagram 1 (The Creative), Gate 2 = Hexagram 2 (The Receptive), etc.
  - See `📖 Library/The Window/The 64 Patterns/` for I-Ching foundation
- **Blueprint Architecture:** HD is the individual expression of the 64-fold cosmic pattern
  - See [[The Blueprint - 444 Architecture]] for synthesis

### Astrology
- **Planetary Activations:** Each gate is activated by planetary positions at birth (and transit)
  - Conscious Sun/Earth, Unconscious Sun/Earth, other planets define gates
  - See `📖 Library/Astrology/` for planetary mechanics
- **Thematic Resonance:** HD Centers correlate to astrological themes
  - Example: Heart Center (Ego) resonates with Leo/Sun themes of willpower

### Jungian Psychology
- **Types as Archetypes:** Each HD Type embodies specific Jungian patterns
  - [[Manifestor]] = The Hero (autonomous initiation)
  - [[Generator]] = The Craftsman (mastery through work)
  - [[Projector]] = The Wise Old Man/Woman (guidance and wisdom)
  - [[Reflector]] = The Mirror (objective witness)
- **Shadow Work:** Not-Self Themes (Anger, Frustration, Bitterness, Disappointment) as Shadow integration
- **Individuation:** Strategy & Authority as the path to psychological wholeness
  - See `📖 Library/Folklore/Jungian Psychology/` for archetypal analysis

### Tarot
- **Thematic Resonance:** Not direct 1:1 mapping, but archetypal parallels
  - Example: [[Manifestor]] resonates with [[The Magician]] (initiation) and [[The Tower]] (disruptive impact)
  - [[Generator]] resonates with [[The Empress]] (fertile abundance) and [[Strength]] (sustained engagement)
  - [[Projector]] resonates with [[The Hermit]] (wisdom through withdrawal)
  - [[Reflector]] resonates with [[The Moon]] (cycles and reflection)
- See `📖 Library/The Tarot/` for Tarot foundation

### Qabalah / The Window
- **Nine Centers as Sephirothic Map:** Potential mapping of Centers to Tree of Life (speculative)
- **64 Gates and Tree Paths:** Each gate as microcosmic path between energy centers
- See `📖 Library/The Window/` for Qabalistic framework

### Angelology
- **Planetary Angels:** Each gate's planetary activation corresponds to angelic intelligences
- See `📖 Library/Angelology/` for planetary-angelic correspondences

*"Human Design is the mechanics of differentiation—the precise map of how each vehicle navigates the totality. To know your Type is to know your correct movement; to follow your Authority is to trust the body's ancient intelligence over the mind's conditioned fear."*
