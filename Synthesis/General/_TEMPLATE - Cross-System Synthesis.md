# {Title: Question or Archetypal Pattern Being Synthesized}

## The Question

{Open with the question itself, rendered in narrative form. What is being asked? Why does it matter? What makes this question require the integration of multiple systems? Draw the reader in with the stakes of the inquiry.}

---

## {First Major Theme or System Integration}

{Write in flowing, mythopoetic prose. Weave the factual data naturally into the narrative rather than presenting it in tables. The reader should encounter the mechanics of each system through the story of their integration, not as clinical data dumps.

Reference the specific positions, gates, cards, or patterns as they become relevant to the argument you're building. For example: "The Sun at 15° Virgo in the 8th house speaks to..." rather than presenting a table of planetary positions.

Use [[wikilinks]] liberally to connect to Library entries.

Each major section should represent a movement in the synthesis—a theme, a tension, a revelation. Name your sections based on the content, not on template structure (i.e., don't use "System 1 Name" as a heading; use "The Threshold Guardians" or "What the Stars Remember" or whatever captures the essence of that section's contribution).}

---

## {Second Major Theme}

{Continue building the synthesis. Show how systems speak to each other—where they converge, where they create productive tension. Don't force agreement; let contradictions reveal complexity.

The goal is emergence: what becomes visible only when multiple systems are held together? This is the Third Meaning—the insight no single system could provide alone.

Write as a scholarly mystic would: precise in terminology, evocative in language, grounded in data but reaching toward the numinous.}

---

## {Third Major Theme, if needed}

{Continue as long as the synthesis requires. Some pieces need three sections, some need seven. Let the content determine structure, not the other way around.

The arc should feel like a journey: question posed, systems consulted, tensions held, insight emerged, implications understood.}

---

## {Practical Wisdom / What This Means}

{Translate archetypal insight into guidance that can be lived. Answer: "So what? What do I do with this?"

This section can include specific recommendations—practices, timing windows, decision frameworks, warning signs—but should still be written in narrative form rather than bullet-pointed lists. The synthesis should feel whole, not fractured into disconnected recommendations.

If timing matters, give specific windows. If practices are needed, describe them with enough detail to enact. If shadow patterns are active, name them clearly so they can be recognized.}

---

## Questions That Remain

{What stays open? What wants further exploration? What can only be understood through lived experience?

A good synthesis gathers what can be gathered but does not pretend to close every aperture. Name what remains unknown.}
