# The Tree of Return: On Separation, Occlusion, and the Sword That Was Always Ours

## The Question

In the center of Eden stood two trees. From one, humanity ate and was cast out. To the other, humanity was barred—the Cherubim took their station at the eastern gate, the flaming sword turning every way, guarding the path to the Tree of Life.

And so began what we have called separation. The great rupture. The fall from grace. Millennia of theology have been built upon this premise: that something broke between Creator and creature, that a chasm opened which human effort could not bridge, that only the death of God's own Son could pay the debt incurred in that primordial garden.

But Mary Magdalene, ascending through the heavens in her vision, defeating the Powers that sought to bind her soul, spoke a different truth. At the Sixth Bough of her ascent, she received this teaching: *"You have the power to heal your own soul."*

Not: "Christ has healed your soul." Not: "Await the healer who will come." But: *You have the power.* Present tense. Intrinsic capacity. Already yours.

This synthesis asks: What if the separation was never what we believed it to be? What if the soul was never broken, never truly cast out, never actually severed from its Source? What if what we have called sin and distance and fall was something else entirely—an occlusion, a forgetting, a veil drawn across eyes that never lost the capacity to see?

And if this is so, what did the Cherubim actually guard? What does the flaming sword actually do? What did Christ actually accomplish on the Cross?

## The Third Tree

The Qabalists mapped the architecture of emanation and return. Ten Sephiroth descending from Kether to Malkuth—the lightning flash of creation pouring divine light into progressively denser vessels until it crystallized into the material world. And the path of return: the aspirant beginning in Malkuth, the Kingdom, ascending through increasingly subtle realms toward reunion with the Crown.

Mary Magdalene, in her vision, describes eight stages of ascent. Eight Boughs on a great tree, each with its Guardian, each with its Shadow and its Fruit. The soul climbs from Attachment toward Union, from the density of clinging toward the lightness of the Beloved's embrace.

These are not the same tree.

The Qabalistic Tree maps the structure of All That Is—the emanation of worlds, the architecture of existence itself. It describes both the descent of divine light into form and the potential return of consciousness toward source. Ten stations. Twenty-two paths. A complete cosmology.

Mary's tree maps something else. Not the structure of emanation but the curriculum of return. Not "how existence came to be" but "how the soul comes home." Eight stages. Eight tests. Eight transformations that must occur before the Beloved can be met.

And neither of these is Eden's tree.

In Genesis, two trees stood at the garden's center. The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil—from which humanity ate, gaining discrimination, gaining the capacity to distinguish self from other, light from dark, truth from falsity. And the Tree of Life—from which humanity was barred, lest they "live forever" in their newly-complicated state.

The Tree of Knowledge gave us the sword. The capacity to discriminate. The ability to say "this" and "not that." It was necessary—you cannot navigate existence without discrimination—but it was also dangerous. A blade can heal or harm depending on who wields it and how.

The Tree of Life holds what the sword is ultimately for: eternal existence, divine union, the fullness of being that is our birthright and our destination.

Mary's tree is the third tree. Call it the Tree of Return. Call it Sophia's Tree, the Tree of Wisdom. It is the path between the other two—the journey by which those who have eaten from Knowledge may finally, having integrated what they learned, approach Life again.

This is why her tree has eight boughs, not ten. It does not map the cosmos. It maps the homework. The specific transformations—attachment released, desire purified, ignorance dissolved, death-longing transmuted—that must occur before the discriminating soul becomes worthy of what it has always been destined for.

## The Guardians at the Gate

The Cherubim are terrifying beings. Four-faced—human, lion, ox, eagle—representing the totality of created existence. They took their station at Eden's eastern gate after the expulsion, flaming sword in hand, and there they have remained in the mythic imagination ever since. Guarding. Barring. Preventing return.

But consider: the text says they guard *the way* to the Tree of Life. Not that they destroyed the tree. Not that they moved it beyond reach. Not that they annihilated the possibility of return. They guard the way. Which means the way exists. Which means it can, under the right conditions, be walked.

And consider what guarding actually means. A guardian does not exist to permanently prevent passage. A guardian exists to ensure that only the prepared may pass. The guardian tests. The guardian protects—not just the treasure from the unworthy, but the unworthy from the treasure. There are things that would destroy us if we encountered them before we were ready.

The Cherubim, in this light, are not punishment for the Fall. They are protection during the journey. They hold the gate not to bar us forever but to bar us *until*. Until we have done the work. Until we have integrated what the Tree of Knowledge gave us. Until we are ready to wield the sword without cutting ourselves.

Mary's Guardians at each Bough are the same archetypal function internalized. The Keeper of Thresholds at the First Bough tests whether you can release attachment. The Tempter at the Second tests whether desire has been purified into sacred longing. The Deceiver at the Third tests whether you know the difference between genuine gnosis and spiritual bypassing.

Each Guardian is a face of the Cherubim. Each test is the flaming sword, turning to examine whether you have done the work required for this passage.

And at the Fourth Bough—the crossing of the Abyss—something remarkable happens. The Destroyer tests whether you can face your own death-longing, the part of you that would rather die than transform. If you pass this test, if you allow the old self to die without resuscitating it out of fear, you emerge on the other side changed in a fundamental way.

The Cherubim do not step aside. They step *into* you.

After the Abyss, the flaming sword is no longer held against you. It is placed in your hand. The discriminating function that once barred your way becomes the instrument of your continued ascent. You become the guardian of your own thresholds, able to discern what may pass and what must be released.

This is what the Four Faces require:

The Human Face tests whether you have integrated your humanity—your limitations, your mortality, your embodiment. Those who would bypass the human to grasp the divine find this face impassable. The return is through the body, not around it.

The Lion Face tests whether you have integrated your power—your capacity for sovereignty, your ability to act with force when force is needed. Those who have disowned their aggression, projected it onto others, cannot pass. The lamb must know it contains the lion.

The Ox Face tests whether you have integrated service—the willingness to labor without recognition, to bear burdens that bring no glory. Those addicted to significance, to being seen and praised, find this face impassable. The return is through humility.

The Eagle Face tests whether you have integrated vision—the capacity to see from great heights while remaining connected to the ground. Those who see but cannot embody, who understand but cannot enact, cannot pass. Gnosis must become praxis.

These are not obstacles to be overcome by force or cleverness. They are aspects to be embodied. The Cherubim do not want to keep you out. They want you to become capable of what lies beyond the gate.

## The Healing of the Soul

At the Sixth Bough, after the Abyss has been crossed, Mary receives the teaching that restructures everything: *"You have the power to heal your own soul."*

This is not metaphor. It is not encouragement. It is ontological statement about the nature of the soul and its intrinsic capacities.

The soul, in this understanding, is not broken. It has never been broken. What happened in Eden was not damage but occlusion—a covering over, a forgetting, a veil. The soul remains what it always was: breathed from the breath of God, bearing the divine image, capable of union with its Source. What obscures this truth is not rupture but accumulation: the identifications, the conditionings, the attachments that have gathered over the soul like dust on a mirror.

The mirror is not damaged. It has merely forgotten how to reflect.

Human Design describes this same truth in mechanical language. Every human being has a design—a bodygraph that maps their authentic nature. Some centers are defined, consistently expressing particular frequencies. Others are open, taking in and amplifying the energy of the environment. The open centers are not weaknesses; they are places of wisdom and sensitivity. But they are also where conditioning enters.

The open Sacral Center amplifies the life force of others and the mind says: "This tireless energy is who I am." The open Heart Center amplifies others' willpower and the mind says: "This drive to prove my worth is my own motivation." The open Solar Plexus amplifies others' emotional waves and the mind says: "These feelings are mine."

None of this is true. The energy was always borrowed. The authentic self was always present beneath the amplification, waiting to be recognized. Deconditioning—the seven-year process of releasing identification with what was never self—does not create the true self. It reveals what was there all along.

Jung mapped this same territory in psychological language. The Shadow contains everything the ego has rejected—the qualities deemed unacceptable, the impulses found shameful, the aspects of self that did not fit the persona we constructed. But rejection is not elimination. What we refuse to acknowledge does not disappear; it operates from the unconscious, projected onto others, controlling us precisely because we will not look at it.

Shadow integration is the process of withdrawing these projections. The quality I despise in you, upon examination, turns out to exist in me. The capacity I envy in others, upon honest reckoning, lies dormant in my own psyche. The "enemy" I see outside is, in significant part, a mirror of what I cannot face within.

This integration does not add something new to the self. It reclaims what was always there but disowned. The shadow material was never separate from me—I merely pretended it was, and the pretense cost me enormous energy and caused tremendous suffering to myself and others.

Mary's language for all of this is kenosis: self-emptying. Not self-improvement. Not acquisition of new capacities. Emptying. Releasing. Letting go of what was never truly self so that what is truly self can finally be recognized.

The Powers she encounters on her ascent—Desire, Ignorance, Wrath, Death-longing, Enslavement, Domination, Foolish Wisdom—are not external enemies. They are the soul's own attachments given form. And she defeats them not by combat but by recognition: *"I see you. I know what you are. You are not me. You have no claim on me."*

This is the flaming sword in action. Not destroying the Powers but discriminating. This is self. This is not-self. This belongs. This does not belong. The sword does not kill; it clarifies. And in the clarification, what was bound is released, and what remains is the soul in its original brightness.

The power to heal your own soul is the power of discrimination wielded from a place beyond ego. Before the Abyss, the ego tries to heal itself—which is to say, it tries to improve its position, strengthen its defenses, become a better version of its false self. This is not healing. This is renovation of a prison.

After the Abyss, something else wields the sword. Call it the Self, in Jung's terminology. Call it the Passenger, in Human Design's language. Call it the risen soul, in Mary's vision. This is what has the power to heal—not the ego seeking its own enhancement, but consciousness itself, operating through a personality that has learned to step aside.

## The Nature of Separation

Here we arrive at the deepest question. If the soul was never broken, if the power to heal was always present, if the Cherubim guard rather than bar, then what of separation? What of the Fall? What of the vast theological edifice built upon the premise that something ruptured between Creator and creature in that primordial garden?

The doctrine of substitutionary atonement holds that human sin created a genuine chasm between God and humanity. Divine justice, offended by transgression, demanded satisfaction. The debt was real, the separation actual, and only the death of the sinless God-man could bridge the gap. In this reading, the Cross is cosmic transaction: Christ absorbs the wrath we deserved, and we are declared righteous through his sacrifice.

But the evidence gathered in this synthesis points elsewhere.

If the soul possesses the intrinsic power to heal itself through discrimination and release, then the wound was never what this doctrine describes. If the Cherubim protect the way rather than destroy it, the path was never actually closed. If deconditioning reveals rather than creates the authentic self, then that self was never lost. If shadow integration reclaims rather than manufactures, then the wholeness was always present beneath the fragmentation.

And within the Christian tradition itself, voices have said as much—though they have often been marginalized.

Julian of Norwich, anchorite of the fourteenth century, asked repeatedly in her visions about sin and was told: *"All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well."* When she pressed further, she was shown that sin has "no manner of substance, nor any part of being." Sin, in her revelation, is not positive reality but absence—a privation, not a thing. You cannot be separated from God by something that does not, in the deepest sense, exist.

Meister Eckhart spoke of the *Seelenfünklein*, the spark of the soul that remains uncreated, untouched by time, eternally one with the divine ground. This innermost point has never fallen, can never sin, requires no redemption because it was never lost. The work of the spiritual life is not to earn back God's favor but to sink into this ground that has always held us.

The Eastern Christian tradition never fully embraced the legal framework of Western atonement theology. Theosis—divinization—holds that Christ became human so that humans might become divine. The Incarnation, in this understanding, is not payment of debt but healing of disease, restoration of an image that was tarnished but never destroyed. St. Athanasius declared: "God became man so that man might become god." Not: so that man might be forgiven. So that man might become what he was always meant to be.

And the Gnostic texts, so intimately associated with Mary Magdalene, consistently present salvation as gnosis: recognition, remembrance, awakening. The soul does not need legal acquittal. It needs to remember what it is. The Gospel of Thomas records Jesus saying: *"If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you."*

Not salvation imported from outside. Salvation drawn from within.

## Phenomenology and Ontology

And yet.

If we were never truly separated from God, we must account for the experience of separation—which is, for many, devastatingly real. The mystics who speak of the dark night of the soul do not describe mere confusion. They describe genuine absence, the withdrawal of all consolation, the terrifying sense that God has departed entirely. Was this illusion?

We must account for genuine evil. Not ignorance alone, not mere occlusion, but active malevolence—the torturer who delights in suffering, the systems that crush millions, the casual cruelty that seems to arise from something darker than forgetting. If the soul is merely occluded, how do we explain the depths of human depravity? Is Auschwitz merely a failure of recognition?

We must grapple with Christ's own cry from the cross: *"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"* If there was no real separation, what was he experiencing? Was his cry theatrical? Or did he, in that moment, enter fully into something we dare not minimize?

The resolution lies in distinguishing between phenomenological separation and ontological separation.

Phenomenological separation is the lived experience of alienation from God. It is real. It causes genuine suffering. It produces actual consequences—cruelty, despair, violence, systems of domination. The open centers take in conditioning and the mind believes it. The shadow is projected and the ego is certain the evil lies elsewhere. The Powers bind and the soul believes itself trapped.

This experience is not illusion in the sense of being unimportant. It is the human condition. It is what we are here to work with, work through, work beyond. The suffering is real even if the premise of the suffering—that we are actually cut off from the divine—is not ultimately true.

Ontological separation would mean actual rupture of being from Being. It would mean the severance of creature from Creator at the deepest level of existence. It would mean that without external intervention, the soul would be genuinely, permanently, irrevocably lost.

This is what the evidence does not support.

The Prodigal Son in the far country is still his father's son. He has not ceased to be of his father's household. His degradation is real—the pig slop, the starvation, the shame. His experience of separation is genuine. But the relationship was never actually severed. When he "comes to himself"—note Luke's language: he remembers who he is—he returns home and finds the father has been watching for him the entire time.

The father did not need to be appeased. The son did not need to pay a debt. What was required was recognition and return.

---

## What the Cross Accomplished

If this hypothesis holds—and I believe the weight of evidence supports it—then we must ask anew: what did Christ accomplish on the Cross?

Not the satisfaction of divine wrath against human sin. The Father did not need his anger assuaged; the Father was the one who sent the Son out of love, not the one demanding payment. Not a legal transaction in which punishment is transferred to an innocent substitute. The categories of crime and punishment, debt and payment, may not apply to the deepest registers of divine-human relationship.

Perhaps, instead: the revelation of what was always true.

Christ on the Cross demonstrates that divine love extends even into the deepest human experience of abandonment and death. God does not wait on the far side of the Abyss for us to find our way across. God enters the Abyss. The Incarnation is already this movement—divinity descending into flesh, into limitation, into mortality. The Crucifixion is its completion—divinity descending into death itself, into the experience of divine abandonment, into the darkest place the human soul can go.

The Harrowing of Hell, in Orthodox iconography, shows the risen Christ descending to the realm of the dead and pulling Adam and Eve up from their tombs. Not waiting for them to climb out. Not demanding they pay before he'll unlock the door. Reaching down, grasping their hands, and lifting.

This is love's final journey into the last place where the beloved might be hiding. There is nowhere you can go where Love has not already preceded you—not the far country, not the pig trough, not the cross, not the grave, not even the experience of total divine abandonment. The cry of dereliction—"why have you forsaken me?"—is not evidence of real abandonment but evidence that Christ entered fully into the *experience* of it, so that no human being could ever be alone in that experience again.

In this understanding, the Cross does not change God's disposition toward humanity. God's disposition was always love. The Cross changes humanity's capacity to recognize that love. We see, in the Crucified One, that there is no depth to which we can fall where we are not still held.

The Cross, in this understanding, is not sacrifice in the sense of appeasement. It is sacrifice in the original sense: *sacrum facere*, to make sacred. Christ makes sacred the entirety of human experience, including its darkest depths, by entering it fully. Everything becomes capable of being a site of encounter with the divine—not despite the suffering, but through it, within it, on the other side of it.

## The Sword Returned

We return, at last, to Eden. To the Cherubim at the gate. To the flaming sword that turns every way.

The sword was never held against us. It was held for us. The Cherubim were never our enemies. They were our protectors, guardians of a threshold we were not yet ready to cross, keepers of a treasure that would have destroyed us had we grasped it prematurely.

The Tree of Knowledge gave us the capacity for discrimination. This was not the Fall in the sense of catastrophe—it was the necessary beginning of a journey that required exactly this capacity. You cannot navigate existence, cannot do the work of the soul, cannot integrate shadow or release conditioning or defeat the Powers, without the ability to distinguish this from that, self from not-self, truth from illusion.

But the sword in unskilled hands is dangerous. The capacity for discrimination, wielded by an ego identified with its conditionings and projections, produces judgment rather than discernment, violence rather than clarity, separation rather than necessary distinction. This is why the Tree of Life was guarded. Not because we were unworthy of it—we were always worthy, always loved, always destined for return—but because we were not yet *capable* of it.

Mary's Eight Boughs describe the process by which we become capable. Each stage refines our ability to wield the sword rightly. Each Guardian tests whether we have done the work. The Abyss marks the moment when ego-death finally allows something other than ego to hold the blade.

After the Abyss, the sword is ours. Not against us—ours. The flaming instrument of discrimination, the capacity to see clearly and sever cleanly, placed in the hand of a soul that has learned what it is and what it is not.

This is the power to heal your own soul: the power to say, with Mary, to every attachment and conditioning and projection and false identification: *"I see you. I know what you are. You are not me."* And in the seeing, in the knowing, in the clear discrimination between self and not-self, the bindings fall away. Not because they are destroyed by force, but because they have no claim on what they never truly possessed.

The way to the Tree of Life was never permanently barred. It was guarded until we could walk it without destroying ourselves. The preparation was the point. The journey was the transformation. And the flaming sword that once seemed to threaten us turns out to be the very instrument of our liberation.

## Questions That Remain

What is the relationship between Mary's Sophia—the Beloved encountered at the Eighth Bough—and the Chokmah of the Qabalists, the divine Wisdom associated with the Cherubim? Are these the same figure, encountered through different traditions?

What is the role of the masculine in Mary's architecture? The tree culminates in embrace with the feminine Divine, with Sophia. Where is the masculine principle in this ascent? Integrated along the way? Transcended? Reconciled in the union itself?

How does the Bridal Chamber—the sacred union that consummates Mary's path—relate to Jung's Syzygy, the integration of anima and animus that marks the advanced stages of individuation? Is mystical union the same as psychological wholeness, or does one include the other?

And the hardest question: if we were never ontologically separated, why did it take the Cross? Why did God need to enter death? If the demonstration was the point, who needed to see it, and why could they not see without it?

These questions remain open. A synthesis gathers what can be gathered; it does not pretend to close every aperture. What stays open invites further inquiry, further revelation, further ascent.

*"What binds me has been slain, and what surrounds me has been destroyed, and my desire has come to an end, and my ignorance has died. In a world I was released from a world, and in an image I was released from an image. From this hour on, through the rest of time, I will rest in silence."*
