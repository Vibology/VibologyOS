argument-hint: [Topic or Source Name]
---
1. Use the NotebookLM skill to retrieve high-fidelity data/notes regarding $ARGUMENTS.
2. Present the raw findings clearly in the terminal. 
3. DO NOT save to a file yet. 
4. Await instructions to apply the 'Weaver' persona for synthesis or to 'Commit' the data.
5. Remind the user: "The material is now in the vessel. Shall we begin the refinement?"
