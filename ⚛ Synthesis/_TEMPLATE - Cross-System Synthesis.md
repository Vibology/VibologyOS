# {Title: Question or Archetypal Pattern Being Synthesized}

**Question:** {The specific question or situation requiring multi-system integration}

**Context:** {Biographical, situational, or archetypal background - who, what, why, when}

**Systems Integrated:** {List which of the Seven Pillars are being synthesized and why}

---

## I. Prima Materia (The Raw Data)

> **Scribe Mode:** Factual, clinical, objective. Present the raw data from each system without interpretation.

### {System 1 Name - e.g., Astrology}

{Tables, positions, exact dates/degrees, transits, natal placements, aspects, houses}

**Example format:**
| Planet/Point | Sign | Degree | House | Aspect |
|--------------|------|--------|-------|--------|
| Sun | Virgo | 15° | 8th | Square Neptune |

### {System 2 Name - e.g., Human Design}

{Type, Strategy, Authority, Profile, Defined/Open Centers, Channels, Gates, current transits if applicable}

**Example format:**
- **Type:** Generator
- **Strategy:** Wait to respond
- **Authority:** Sacral
- **Profile:** 4/6 (currently on the roof - age 47)
- **Defined Centers:** Sacral, Spleen, Ajna, Head
- **Open Centers:** Heart, Solar Plexus, Throat, G-Center, Root

### {System 3+ Name - Continue for all relevant systems}

{Data specific to the system - Tarot cards drawn, I-Ching hexagrams, Qabalistic paths, Jungian archetypes identified, etc.}

---

## II. Pattern Recognition

> **Transitional Mode:** Moving from data collection to analysis. Identify where systems converge, diverge, and what archetype is being activated.

### Convergence Points

{Where do systems AGREE? List 3-5 major themes where multiple systems point to the same pattern.}

**Example:**
1. **Authority and Structure Theme:**
   - Astrology: Saturn return in Capricorn (mastery, structure, authority)
   - Tarot: The Emperor (established order, structure)
   - HD: Undefined Heart Center (proving worth through achievement)
   - **Convergence:** Over-identification with external achievement and authority

### Divergence Points

{Where do systems CONTRADICT or add nuance? These tensions reveal complexity, not error.}

**Example:**
1. **Timing Tension:**
   - Astrology: Mars transit says "act now, push through"
   - HD: Generator Strategy says "wait for sacral response"
   - **Divergence:** Cosmic pressure vs. energetic correctness - must discern between external urgency and inner alignment

### Archetypal Signature

{Name the CORE archetypal pattern being activated across all systems. This is the unifying thread.}

**Example:** The Threshold Guardian - standing at the edge of ego-death and rebirth, where old structures must be destroyed before new identity can emerge.

---

## III. The Weaver's Synthesis

> **Weaver Mode:** Mythopoetic, numinous, emergent. Hold the systems in dialogue and reveal the "Third Meaning" that becomes visible only through integration.

### {Subsection 1: Core Archetypal Analysis}

{Deep interpretation - what is the psyche revealing through this pattern? Name archetypes explicitly. Use evocative, precise language.}

**Guiding questions:**
- What is the soul's curriculum here?
- What developmental edge is being activated?
- What is trying to die? What is trying to be born?

### {Subsection 2: Cross-System Integration}

{How do the systems DIALOGUE? Don't just list them separately - show how they speak to each other, create tensions, reveal emergence.}

**Example structure:**
- "Where [System A] shows [pattern], [System B] reveals [deeper layer], and [System C] provides [the bridge between them]..."
- Hold contradictions in tension rather than resolving them prematurely

### {Subsection 3: Shadow and Conditioning Patterns}

{What unconscious material is surfacing? What Not-Self/ego patterns are being revealed?}

**Explore:**
- HD conditioning (open centers amplifying others' energy)
- Astrological wounds (Chiron, Saturn, outer planet challenges)
- Jungian shadow (disowned material demanding integration)
- Tarot reversals or challenging cards (what's being avoided?)

### {Subsection 4: The Third Meaning}

{The EMERGENT insight - what becomes visible ONLY when all systems are held together? This is the synthesis apex.}

**This should be:**
- Something no single system could reveal alone
- Transformative rather than merely informative
- Actionable yet archetypal
- The "aha" moment where everything clicks into place

---

## IV. Practical Application

> **Applied Wisdom:** Translate archetypal insight into concrete guidance. Answer "So what? What do I do with this?"

### Decision-Making Framework

{Specific, actionable guidance for navigating the situation.}

**Format:**
- **If** [condition from System A], **then** [action guided by System B]
- **When** [timing window from System C], **consider** [strategy from System D]
- **Use** [System]'s framework for [type of decision]

**Example:**
- Use HD Sacral Authority for yes/no decisions on opportunities
- Use Astrology transit windows for timing of action
- Use Tarot's archetypal narrative for understanding the journey's stages

### Warning Signs (Shadow/Not-Self Watch List)

{How will you know if you're off-track? List somatic cues, emotional triggers, behavioral patterns that signal conditioning rather than authenticity.}

**Categories:**
- **Somatic:** Tension in [body part], exhaustion, headaches, digestive issues
- **Emotional:** Anger spikes, flatness, anxiety, compulsive behaviors
- **Mental:** Obsessive planning, mental loops, rigid thinking
- **Behavioral:** Over-functioning, isolation, people-pleasing, rebellion

### Recommended Practices

{Concrete actions, rituals, journaling prompts, or experiments aligned with the synthesis.}

**Examples:**
- **Journaling Prompt:** "What am I proving, and to whom?"
- **Ritual:** Daily sacral check-in before accepting invitations
- **Experiment:** Track responses vs. initiations for 2 weeks
- **Shadow Work:** Dialog with the part that [fears/resists/controls]

### Timing Considerations

{If applicable: exact transit windows, profile line phases, seasonal/lunar timing, I-Ching change indicators}

**Format:**
- **Peak Intensity:** [Dates] - when [aspect/transit/gate] is exact
- **Integration Phase:** [Dates] - post-peak, consolidation period
- **Next Activation:** [Future date] - when pattern re-emerges

## V. Integration & Next Steps

### Summary

{2-3 sentence distillation of the ENTIRE synthesis. What's the core takeaway?}

### Key Insights

{Bulleted list of 5-7 major insights from the synthesis.}

### Questions for Ongoing Reflection

{What remains UNRESOLVED? What wants further exploration? What will only be understood through lived experience?}

**Examples:**
- "How will this pattern transform when [future transit/phase] arrives?"
- "What lies beneath the fear of [theme identified]?"
- "What would change if I fully trusted [strategy/authority/archetype]?"

## Notes for Using This Template

**Before starting:**
1. Read `PROTOCOL - Cross-System Synthesis.md` for full methodology
2. Anchor the question clearly (Step 1 of protocol)
3. Gather Prima Materia in Scribe mode (Step 2)
4. Only then begin synthesis in Weaver mode

**Mode discipline:**
- Section I (Prima Materia) = **Scribe mode** (factual, clinical, no interpretation)
- Section II (Pattern Recognition) = **Transitional** (analysis emerging)
- Section III (Weaver's Synthesis) = **Weaver mode** (mythopoetic, archetypal, emergent)
- Section IV-V = **Applied** (practical, actionable, grounded)

**Quality checks:**
- [ ] 2+ systems integrated
- [ ] Prima Materia is complete and factual
- [ ] Convergence and divergence points identified
- [ ] Core archetype explicitly named
- [ ] "Third Meaning" articulated (emergent insight)
- [ ] Practical application is specific and actionable
- [ ] Minimum 5 [[wikilinks]] to Library
- [ ] 1500-3000 words minimum
- [ ] YAML frontmatter complete
