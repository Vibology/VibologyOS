# Suggested Source Texts

**Created:** 2026-02-12
**Purpose:** Gaps in the ~/Archetypal Studies/ and ~/Human Design/ reference corpora, prioritized by relevance to VibologyOS synthesis work.

---

## Priority 1 — The Astrology Bridge

The largest gap in the source library. The Jungian depth psychology corpus is essentially complete; the HD corpus covers the full IHDS curriculum. What's missing is the literature that **bridges** these two into the practitioner's tradition: Traditional Archetypal / Psycho-Astrology.

### Liz Greene

The primary architect of the Jungian-astrological synthesis. Every title below applies Jungian depth psychology directly to chart interpretation.

| Title | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil** | Greene's first book. Saturn as Shadow — the foundational text of psycho-astrology. Reframes malefic as individuation agent. |
| **The Astrology of Fate** | Moira, the Fates, karma through a Jungian lens. The philosophical backbone of archetypal astrology. |
| **Relating: An Astrological Guide to Living with Others** | Synastry and composite through projection/anima-animus mechanics. |
| **Neptune: The Quest for Redemption** | Neptune as collective longing, addiction, mysticism, dissolution. One of her most substantial works. |
| **The Astrological Neptune and the Quest for Redemption** | Extended edition of the above — verify if separate or same text. |
| **The Dark of the Soul: Psychopathology in the Horoscope** | CPA seminar — psychological disturbance through the chart. |

### Greene & Sasportas (CPA Seminar Series)

The Centre for Psychological Astrology seminars — Greene's Jungian theory meets Sasportas's practical chart application. These are the working methodology of psycho-astrology.

| Title | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **The Development of the Personality** (CPA Vol. 1) | Planets as psychological functions, chart as individuation map. |
| **The Luminaries** (CPA Vol. 3) | Sun and Moon — ego-consciousness and the maternal matrix. |
| **The Inner Planets** (CPA Vol. 4) | Mercury, Venus, Mars as personal archetypal functions. |
| **Dynamics of the Unconscious** (CPA Vol. 2) | Outer planets as transpersonal forces. |

### Howard Sasportas

| Title | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **The Twelve Houses: Exploring the Houses of the Horoscope** | The definitive psychological treatment of the house system. |
| **The Gods of Change: Pain, Crisis and the Transits of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto** | Outer planet transits as initiatory crises. |

### Chris Brennan

| Title | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Hellenistic Astrology: The Study of Fate and Fortune** | The technical Hellenistic reference — the tradition's historical foundation. Sect, domicile, exaltation, decan, bound, lots, time-lords. The source for expanding the Library's astrology entries with primary Hellenistic mechanics. |

### Richard Tarnas

| Title | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Cosmos and Psyche: Intimations of a New World View** | The philosophical argument for archetypal astrology — planetary archetypes correlated with historical events. Bridges Jung's synchronicity with astrological practice. |
| **The Passion of the Western Mind** | Background — the intellectual history that makes archetypal astrology intelligible. Not strictly necessary but provides the epistemological frame. |

## Priority 2 — Von Franz Gaps

The core library (12 works) is strong. These additions fill specific synthesis needs.

| Title | Why | Priority |
|-------|-----|----------|
| **Creation Myths** | Archetypal cosmogony — directly relevant to the Angelology/emanation layer where creation narratives intersect with hierarchical consciousness. The highest-value von Franz addition. | High |
| **C.G. Jung: His Myth in Our Time** | Her biographical study of Jung. Useful for the Personal Mythos pillar — Jung's life as archetypal pattern. | Medium |
| **Archetypal Patterns in Fairy Tales** | Her late, comprehensive fairy tale work — synthesizes the earlier individual studies. | Medium |
| **Psyche and Matter** | Essays on psyche-matter complementarity. Relevant to HD's neutrino/form mechanics read through a Jungian lens. | Low |
| **Aurora Consurgens** | Alchemical text attributed to Aquinas, edited by von Franz. Specialized — relevant only if Tarot/alchemy synthesis deepens into primary alchemical sources. | Low |

---

## Priority 3 — Hillman Gaps

The essential Hillman (5 works) covers the archetypal psychology foundation. These additions target specific archetypal domains.

| Title | Why | Priority |
|-------|-----|----------|
| **Anima: An Anatomy of a Personified Notion** | The definitive archetypal psychology treatment of anima. Central to Venus/Moon work in chart interpretation — the contrasexual archetype is one of the main bridges between Jungian psychology and astrology. | High |
| **The Myth of Analysis: Three Essays in Archetypal Psychology** | The companion to Re-Visioning Psychology. Eros and psyche, the Aphrodite archetype, the pathologizing of Eros. Directly relevant to Venus/relational astrology. | High |
| **A Terrible Love of War** | Mars archetype — aggression, war, the beauty in destruction. Relevant to Mars in chart interpretation. | Medium |
| **Pan and the Nightmare** | Instinct, panic, the nature god. Relevant to the Splenic awareness stream (instinct/survival) in HD cross-system synthesis. | Medium |
| **Suicide and the Soul** | Early Hillman — the soul's perspective on death-wish, contra clinical reduction. Background for understanding his break from therapeutic literalism. | Low |
| **The Force of Character: And the Lasting Life** | Aging, senescence, character as fate. Relevant to Saturn Return / life cycles work. | Low |

---

## Priority 4 — Hellenistic Primary Sources

For when the Library's astrology entries expand with primary Hellenistic mechanics. These are the historical texts that Brennan's *Hellenistic Astrology* draws from.

| Title | Author | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Tetrabiblos** | Ptolemy (2nd c. CE) | The canonical ancient astrology text. Robbins translation (Loeb) is standard. |
| **Anthology** | Vettius Valens (2nd c. CE) | The practitioner's text — techniques, time-lords, profections. Riley translation available free online. |
| **Carmen Astrologicum** | Dorotheus of Sidon (1st c. CE) | Electional and natal techniques. Pingree translation. |
| **Mathesis** | Firmicus Maternus (4th c. CE) | Late Hellenistic synthesis — the most complete surviving ancient manual. |

---

## Priority 5 — Supporting Authors

Not core to the tradition but potentially useful for specific synthesis threads.

| Title | Author | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Ego and Archetype** | Edward Edinger | Individuation mapped through archetypal stages. Accessible bridge between CW and clinical application. |
| **Anatomy of the Psyche: Alchemical Symbolism in Psychotherapy** | Edward Edinger | The alchemical stages (calcinatio, solutio, etc.) as psychological operations. Relevant if the Tarot/alchemy layer deepens. |
| **The Planets Within** | Thomas Moore | Marsilio Ficino's astrology read through Hillman's archetypal psychology. Renaissance astral magic meets depth psychology — directly relevant to the Astrology/Personal Mythos intersection. |

## Notes

- The astrology bridge (Priority 1) is the structural gap — the Jungian and HD corpora are comprehensive, but the literature connecting Jungian psychology to astrological practice is entirely absent from disk.
- Greene/Sasportas texts may be difficult to source as PDFs — the CPA seminar books have been out of print periodically. Physical copies may be more accessible.
- Brennan's *Hellenistic Astrology* is the single highest-impact acquisition for expanding the Library's astrology pillar with primary source mechanics.
- Valens's *Anthology* (Riley translation) is freely available online — no purchase necessary.
- Acquisition should follow curriculum needs — one text at a time as the study reaches each source, per the local reference library transition plan.
