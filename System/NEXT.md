# Current Work Context

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-25
**System Status:** ✅ OPERATIONAL - Phase 8 Human Design COMPLETE ✅
**Current Focus:** 643/643 files verified (100% complete) - 🎉 LIBRARY VERIFICATION COMPLETE

---

## ✅ CRITICAL ERROR RESOLVED (2026-01-25)

**Problem (Discovered 2026-01-24):** 15 out of 20 Angelology files were marked "complete" but lacked mandatory References sections and proper inline citations.

**Impact:** Only 5/20 files (25%) initially met verification standard. True progress was 13/643 files (2%), not 33/643 (5%).

**Root Cause:** Protocol document lacked enforcement mechanism. Quality gates existed but were not strictly applied.

**Resolution:**
1. ✅ Updated `PROTOCOL - Prima Materia Verification.md` to make citations MANDATORY
2. ✅ Created `CHECKLIST - Verification Quality Control.md` for enforcement
3. ✅ **COMPLETE:** All 15 files remediated (2026-01-25)

---

## REMEDIATION COMPLETED (2026-01-25)

**Objective:** Add References sections and complete inline citations for all 15 files before proceeding with new work.

**Status:** ✅ **ALL 15 FILES REMEDIATED**

## Chart Generation Workflow

### Human Design Bodygraph
```bash
# 1. Verify geolocation
python verify_geolocation.py --place "City, Country" --birth-date "YYYY-MM-DD" --pretty

# 2. Start HD API (if not running)
cd humandesign_api && uvicorn humandesign.api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 &

# 3. Calculate chart and get JSON
python get_hd_data.py --name "Name" --year YYYY --month M --day D --hour H --minute M \
  --place "City, Country" --lat XX.XXX --lng YY.YYY > humandesign.json

# 4. Generate bodygraph PNG via API
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/bodygraph?year=YYYY&month=M&day=D&hour=H&minute=M&place=City,Country&format=png" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HD_API_TOKEN" -o bodygraph.png
```

### Astrology Natal Chart (Kerykeion)
```python
from kerykeion import AstrologicalSubject, KerykeionChartSVG

subject = AstrologicalSubject(
    name="Name",
    year=YYYY, month=M, day=D, hour=H, minute=M,
    city="City", nation="XX",
    lat=XX.XXX, lng=YY.YYY,
    tz_str="Timezone/String"
)

chart = KerykeionChartSVG(subject, theme="classic")
chart.makeSVG(minify=False, remove_css_variables=True)
# Output: ~/Name - Natal Chart.svg (move to desired location)
```
