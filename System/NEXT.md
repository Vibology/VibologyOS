**Current Focus:** Angelology dead link resolution and structural consistency

---

## ✅ ANGELOLOGY RESTRUCTURING COMPLETE (2026-01-26)

**Objective:** Reconcile angelic hierarchy naming conventions and resolve all dead wikilinks in Angelology pillar.

**Key Discovery:** VibologyOS was using "Nine Angelic Orders" but the canonical Wang/Golden Dawn Qabalistic system uses **ten orders** (Christian Dionysian = 9; Qabalistic = 10, extending to Malkuth).

**Structural Changes:**
1. ✅ Renamed `The Nine Angelic Orders/` → `The Ten Angelic Orders/`
2. ✅ Renamed main file: `The Nine Angelic Orders.md` → `The Ten Angelic Orders.md`
3. ✅ Added 10th order (Ishim/Ashim for Malkuth) to all tables and hierarchies
4. ✅ Updated all content to distinguish Christian (9) vs. Qabalistic (10) systems
5. ✅ Moved Golachab.md from Angelology to The Tarot/Qabalah (Qlippoth is Qabalistic, not Angelological)

**Cleanup:**
- ✅ Deleted 4 duplicate stubs: Ashim.md, Malachim.md, Bene Elohim.md, Tarshishim.md
- ✅ Fixed ~40 wikilinks in archangel files (Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, Uriel)
- ✅ Fixed Hebrew name alignment in 4 archangel files (Haniel, Michael, Tzadkiel, Tzaphkiel)
- ✅ Fixed Cherubim.md YAML syntax error (unquoted colon)
- ✅ Ensured consistency throughout The Ten Angelic Orders.md (all "nine" → "ten" where appropriate)

**Dead Wikilink Resolution (2026-01-26):**
- ✅ Built normalization script mapping 778 Library files to wikilink references
- ✅ Fixed 80 dead wikilinks across 9 angelic order files using Obsidian alias syntax
- ✅ Reduced dead links: 233 → 129 (44% reduction)
- ✅ Normalized: Tarot Major Arcana, Gates, Sephiroth cross-references
- 📊 Remaining 129 dead links: Files not yet created (Lucifer, Guardian Angel, Ein Sof, Divine Names, Jungian concepts, mythology entries, mystical practices)

**Commits:**
- bd88371: Fix Hebrew name formatting (4 files)
- 075f04f: Restructure Nine → Ten Angelic Orders (major)
- 17f1e5b: Move Golachab to Qabalah section
- 376dafe: Fix Cherubim YAML syntax
- 86d2185: Ensure consistency in The Ten Angelic Orders.md
- b5d3de0: Fix 80 dead wikilinks using alias syntax (normalize_angelic_wikilinks.py)

**Sources Verified:** NotebookLM confirmed Wang p.115, 266; Davidson p.336-337

**Status:** Angelology structural consistency complete ✅ | Dead link resolution: 44% complete (80/233 fixed, 129 reference non-existent files)

---

## ✅ CRITICAL ERROR RESOLVED (2026-01-25)

**Problem (Discovered 2026-01-24):** 15 out of 20 Angelology files were marked "complete" but lacked mandatory References sections and proper inline citations.

**Impact:** Only 5/20 files (25%) initially met verification standard. True progress was 13/643 files (2%), not 33/643 (5%).

**Root Cause:** Protocol document lacked enforcement mechanism. Quality gates existed but were not strictly applied.

**Resolution:**
1. ✅ Updated `PROTOCOL - Prima Materia Verification.md` to make citations MANDATORY
2. ✅ Created `CHECKLIST - Verification Quality Control.md` for enforcement
3. ✅ **COMPLETE:** All 15 files remediated (2026-01-25)

---

## REMEDIATION COMPLETED (2026-01-25)

**Objective:** Add References sections and complete inline citations for all 15 files before proceeding with new work.

**Status:** ✅ **ALL 15 FILES REMEDIATED**

### Summary of Work Completed

## Chart Generation Workflow

### Human Design Bodygraph
```bash
# 1. Verify geolocation
python verify_geolocation.py --place "City, Country" --birth-date "YYYY-MM-DD" --pretty

# 2. Start HD API (if not running)
cd humandesign_api && uvicorn humandesign.api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 &

# 3. Calculate chart and get JSON
python get_hd_data.py --name "Name" --year YYYY --month M --day D --hour H --minute M \
  --place "City, Country" --lat XX.XXX --lng YY.YYY > humandesign.json

# 4. Generate bodygraph PNG via API
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/bodygraph?year=YYYY&month=M&day=D&hour=H&minute=M&place=City,Country&format=png" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HD_API_TOKEN" -o bodygraph.png
```

### Astrology Natal Chart (Kerykeion)
```python
from kerykeion import AstrologicalSubject, KerykeionChartSVG

subject = AstrologicalSubject(
    name="Name",
    year=YYYY, month=M, day=D, hour=H, minute=M,
    city="City", nation="XX",
    lat=XX.XXX, lng=YY.YYY,
    tz_str="Timezone/String"
)

chart = KerykeionChartSVG(subject, theme="classic")
chart.makeSVG(minify=False, remove_css_variables=True)
# Output: ~/Name - Natal Chart.svg (move to desired location)
```
