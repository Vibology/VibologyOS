## Available Work Paths

### 1. Client Synthesis
- All chart calculation tools operational
- Library verified and cross-referenced
- Follow `PROTOCOL - Client Work.md`

### 2. Oracle Deck Restructure (Active)

**The Window → The Astrolabe — 88-card Oracle Deck**

The Window is being rebuilt from the ground up. The current 64-card system forced gates into interpretive categories rather than honoring what they are. The restructure separates the interpretive layer from the 64-fold architecture.

**New structure (88 cards):**
- **The Athanor** (24 cards): The Materia (5) + The Furnace (7) + The Archetypes (12)
- **The Codex** (64 cards): 8 trigram families × 8 cards, each named for what the gate/hexagram/key actually is

**Decisions made:** Structure, part names, sub-groups, card counts, trigram family organization (lower trigram)
**All Phase 0 decisions resolved (2026-02-03):**
- Deck name: **The Astrolabe** (Greek *astrolabon*, "star-taker")
- Card naming: I-Ching hexagram name, best English translation (1-2 words); 13 reworked from Wilhelm
- Trigram families: English image names (Heaven, Earth, Thunder, Water, Mountain, Wind, Fire, Lake)
- Archetype gate resonances: Full detachment — Archetypes are zodiacal/Jungian only; gates belong to the Codex

**Planning document:** `System/PLAN - Oracle Deck Restructure.md`

Current Window content (76 files) will be archived when build begins. The work was the necessary 29-46 commitment through which the need for precision became visible.

### 3. Library Expansion

**Pending: IHDS Foundation Sequence Materials**
Acquiring LYD manual ($50) and planning foundation course sequence (LYD $300, Rave ABCs $400, Rave Cartography $750). Library updates for HD foundational material are **on hold** until source texts are in hand. Known gaps to address with those sources:
- **Definition Types** — Single, Split, Triple-Split, Quadruple-Split (no file exists; flagged in BodyGraph.md)
- **Projector Subcategories** — Classic, Energy, Mental (not in Projector.md)
- **Deconditioning** — Stub exists, needs expansion
- **Unknown-unknowns** — LYD curriculum likely covers experiential/pedagogical material not represented in Ra's reference texts

Once acquired, scan and add to Grimoire for source-grounded expansion.

**Stub files available for expansion (existing material):**
- Qabalah subsystem (35 stubs) — Sephiroth, Divine Names, Tree of Life
- Mythology deities (16 stubs) — archetypal anchors
- Jungian concepts (12 stubs) — Synchronicity, Transcendent Function, etc.
- Practice guides (10 stubs) — LBRP, Pathworking, etc.

**Recently addressed:** Gate dignity data corrections
- Three errors fixed (26.2, 47.3, 59.6) and verified in Abbey Lewis chart
- Future additions tracked in `humandesign_api/EXALTATION_DETRIMENT_ERRATA.md`

### 4. New Synthesis Work
- `Synthesis/General/` ready for new pieces
- Template: `_TEMPLATE - Cross-System Synthesis.md`
- Note: Re-synthesize "Tree of Return" when ready (deleted pre-verification version)

## Session History

**2026-01-31 (Late Night):** Oracle Deck restructure — The Window rebuilt from the ground up
- Identified core problem: current 64-card Window forces gates into interpretive categories rather than honoring what they are ("Stability" = Gate 20, but Gate 20 IS "Contemplation — The Now")
- **Principle reaffirmed:** "I use precise tools precisely" — the 64 gates/keys/hexagrams must exist as themselves
- Restructured from 64 cards to **88 cards** in two parts:
  - **The Athanor** (24 cards): The Materia (5: Prima Materia, Sulphur, Mercury, Salt, Philosopher's Stone) + The Furnace (7: classical alchemical operations) + The Archetypes (12: zodiacal personas, detached from gate ownership)
  - **The Codex** (64 cards): 8 trigram families × 8, each card named for the actual hexagram/gate/key
- Retired The Ten Portals (replaced by Furnace + Materia) and The Six Houses (replaced by 8 trigram families)
- 88 = 44 × 2 (angel deck tradition doubled) = 88 constellations (complete observable sky from the Observatory)
- Corrected 4 errors in Hexagrams.md trigram family table (hex 24, 33, 44, 54 were missing; 9, 16, 26, 45 were duplicated)
- **Decisions pending (wave processing):** deck name (candidates: Spectrum, Dial, Transmission, Constellation), Codex card naming convention, trigram family naming, Archetype gate resonances
- Planning document created: `System/PLAN - Oracle Deck Restructure.md`
- The Window name retired — no longer fits what this instrument is becoming
- Current 76 files of Window content to be archived when build begins; recognized as necessary 29-46 Channel of Discovery work, not waste

**2026-01-30 (Night):** Offerings page development — structure, content drafting, visual identity
- Brainstormed Offerings menu structure: established four service categories
- Named flagship multi-system offering **Archetypal Portrait** (charts + synthesis + Tarot/Oracle)
- Resolved pillar integration: Angelology and Magdalene Path are **practitioner-depth** systems (inform how you read, not what you present); Jungian/Personal Mythos is the interpretive language; four client-facing systems (Astrology, HD, Tarot, Window)
- Drafted and finalized **Astrology** page content (Jung quote, natal + transit services, written report emphasis)
- Drafted and finalized **Human Design** page content (Ra quote, Foundation/Cross/Relationship/Transit readings)
- Drafted and finalized **Tarot & Oracle** page content (Jung quote, Tarot/Oracle/Combined readings, Window Cards as proprietary companion system)
- **Visual identity cohesion:** Established site-wide image palette (dark teal base, amber/gold accents, cinematic depth). Re-generated HD and Astrology featured images to match. Generated Tarot & Oracle image (card + Elder Futhark runestones). All images now visually consistent.
- Generated blank bodygraph SVGs (with/without gate numbers) via humandesign_api renderer for image generation reference
- Drafted and finalized **Archetypal Portrait** page content (Anaïs Nin quote, three-movement structure: Architecture/Synthesis/Living Moment, two-session delivery model, prerequisite note for non-first-time clients, "Table of Contents for the story of You" closing)
- Featured image generated: open book with converging geometric systems rising from pages
- Drafted **Recommended Reading** page content (Mahler quote, five sections: Archetypal Psychology, Astrology, Human Design, Tarot, The Window — sources from Esoteric Grimoire only)
  - Excluded Rave I'Ching and Line Companion due to known dignity data errors
  - Added Archetypal Psychology section (Jung MDR, Campbell, von Franz)
  - Considering Chetan Parkyn's *Human Design* and *The Book of Lines* for future addition (pending acquisition and Grimoire inclusion)
  - Amazon affiliate links deferred until site has traffic
- **Full visual identity audit and cohesion pass:** Re-generated About (observatory), Ethics (scales), Human Design (bodygraph), and FAQ (compass) images to match established palette. All 8 featured images now share consistent teal/amber/illustrated style. Visual language documented in `~/Business/Website/STYLE-GUIDE.md`
- **All four Offerings pages + Recommended Reading complete and published to Ghost**

**2026-01-30 (Evening):** Practitioner's Ethics — from IHDS stance to ethics statement
- Explored mechanical basis for rejecting institutional certification while valuing education
- Discovered the **Four-Channel Learning Model** — all four defined channels (34-57, 6-59, 5-15, 29-46) form a complete learning sequence: Logic evaluates, Abstract commits to experience, Tribal seeks interpersonal transmission, Integration retains sovereign authority over application
- Identified that Tribal channel (6-59) has been underfed — Collective side (building, systematizing) heavily active, interpersonal learning hunger recognized
- Articulated the **Synthesis Principle**: learn each system's language independently (Hellenistic astrology, Jungian psychology), perform synthesis in the Observatory rather than inheriting someone else's
- Evaluated Library's astrological tradition: Traditional (Hellenistic/Medieval) foundations with Jungian-Psychological integration — "Archetypal Traditional" or "Psycho-Traditional"
- Researched potential astrology mentors: Brennan, Demetra George, Elenbaas, Liz Greene, Austin Coppock
- Evaluated Chris Brennan's course bundle (Hellenistic + Electional + Professional) — language, application, craft. No synthesis imposed. Live webinars provide Tribal dimension. Not a final decision — wave processing.
- Distinguished **objective certification** (competence) from **subjective certification** (allegiance) — reusable evaluation tool
- Document evolved from IHDS stance → learning model → practitioner's ethics statement
- Saved as `~/Personal/Biography/The Practitioner's Ethics — Mechanical Basis for a Rigorous Practice.md`
- **Drafted public Ethics page for Vibology website** — 11 ethical standards including clarity over comfort, rigor over vibes, no spiritual bypassing, transparency of method, client authority, lived experience as credential, no determinism, confidentiality and consent, scope of practice, non-discrimination. Published to Ghost.
- CLAUDE.md updated to V4.8 (added Practitioner's Design section §3)

**2026-01-30:** HD foundation assessment and IHDS decision
- Audited entire HD library (345 files) against Living Your Design curriculum
- Confirmed strong mechanical coverage (Types, Strategy, Authority, Centers, Gates, Channels, Profiles, Crosses, Variables all complete)
- Identified three concrete gaps: Definition Types, Projector Subcategories, Deconditioning detail
- Queried Grimoire — confirmed Ra's source texts cover Projector subtypes (Classic/Energy/Mental) and Generator subtypes (Pure/MG); Manifestors and Reflectors have no formal subcategories
- **Decision (processed through emotional wave):** Purchase LYD manual and complete IHDS foundation sequence (LYD, Rave ABCs, Rave Cartography) as source material — but decline further IHDS certification. The Observatory is not built inside someone else's institution.
- **Stance reminder:** Open Root wants to rush toward readiness. Open Heart says credentialing equals legitimacy. Both are Not-Self conditioning. Strategy and Authority override both. Still building. Still on the roof.

**2026-01-29 (Evening):** Chart workflow validation and protocol streamlining
- **Dignity data fixes:** Corrected three errors in exaltations_detriments.json
  - 26.2: North Node now exalted (was Sun)
  - 47.3: Sun now in detriment (was Mars)
  - 59.6: Mercury detriment now null/unknown (was Mercury)
- **Chart rendering improvements:**
  - Added city/nation to astrology.json meta output (fixes "Greenwich, GB" default)
  - Created `generate_chart_visuals.py` script for consistent SVG generation
  - Script handles both bodygraph and natal chart in single command
- **Protocol streamlining:** Removed redundancy between Client Work and Chart Data Acquisition
  - Added Protocol Scope sections clarifying workflow vs. technical boundaries
  - Eliminated duplicate file organization and birth data sections
  - Strengthened transit calculation mandate with ⚠️ MANDATORY flags
  - Reduced duplicate content by ~30 lines while maintaining clarity
- **Workflow validation:**
  - Tested complete new-client workflow with John Smith (birth data → full chart package)
  - Phrasing "New Client [Name], birth data [details]" successfully triggers full protocol
  - Generated Abbey Lewis Initial Client Report (6,200 words) following template
- **Result:** Chart generation workflow is production-ready; protocols are leaner and clearer

**2026-01-28 (Late Evening):** Observatory metaphor integration
- Integrated "The Observatory" as governing identity metaphor across three documents
- CLAUDE.md V4.7: Observatory framing in Core Identity, Intelligence Hierarchy, and Personas
- PROTOCOL - Client Work: Added Observatory Stance section (client as invited observer, not passive recipient)
- PROTOCOL - Cross-System Synthesis v1.1: Added Observatory Stance to Quality Standards (Third Meaning as observed, not manufactured)
- Origin: The glass house (false openness, Mars detriment at 59.3) destroyed by Saturn-Pluto conjunction 2020-01-12; what replaced it is the Observatory — built for seeing, not for protection
- Existing structures (Weaver, Scribe, Pillars, Refinement Cycle) unchanged — Observatory is the container that was always implied
- Pondering: Whether to change Vibology symbol from Seed of Life to observatory (sitting with emotional wave — no action yet)

**2026-02-03:** Oracle Deck — all Phase 0 decisions resolved
- **Deck name:** The Astrolabe (Greek *astrolabon*, "star-taker") — ancient observatory instrument; "a universe in your hand"
- **Card naming convention:** I-Ching hexagram name as primary, best English translation, 1-2 words. 13 names reworked from Wilhelm: Emergence (3), Accretion (9), Fellowship (13), Bounty (14), Remedy (18), Amassing (26), Overwhelm (28), Clinging Fire (30), Might (34), Wounded Light (36), Encountering (44), Marrying Maiden (54), Overstep (62)
- **Trigram family naming:** English image names (Heaven, Earth, Thunder, Water, Mountain, Wind, Fire, Lake); Chinese/symbol as correspondences
- **Archetype gate resonances:** Full detachment — Archetypes are zodiacal/Jungian figures only; all gate correspondences belong exclusively to the 64 Codex cards
- Phase 0 complete. Ready for Phase 1 (Archive & Restructure) when the wave settles.

**2026-01-28 (Evening):** Dignity data architecture decision
- Evaluated whether to include exaltation/detriment data in Library gate entries
- **Decision:** Do not add structured dignity tables to Library entries yet
  - API JSON (`exaltations_detriments.json`) remains computational source of truth
  - Errata document tracks corrections as discovered through real chart work
  - Library entries retain interpretive content without raw dignity tables
  - Revisit when errata stabilizes (after 20-30 more charts without new errors)
- Discussed systematic verification approach (Sun transit schedule for all 384 gate/lines)
  - Feasible but unnecessary given organic verification through client work
  - Each chart naturally verifies 13 gate/line combinations
- Key learning: Chart arrow notation now understood
  - Left/right arrows = Variables (Digestion, Environment, Perspective, Motivation)
  - Up/down arrows = Dignity indicators (exaltation ↑ / detriment ↓)

**2026-01-28 (PM):** Split-aspect gate indicators and dignity data integration
- Implemented split-aspect gate indicators via colored borders on gate circles:
  - Red/black split border: both design and personality aspects
  - Full red border: design-only activation
  - Full black border: personality-only activation
- Changed default bodygraph export format from PNG to SVG for scalability
- Added exaltation/detriment dignity data to `get_hd_data.py` script:
  - Each planet now includes `dignity` field ("exalted", "detriment", or null)
  - Supports synthesis protocol requirement for traceable claims
- Updated protocols:
  - Chart Data Acquisition: Added bodygraph SVG generation step
  - Client Work: Added bodygraph.svg to workflow and file organization
- Generated Szilvia Williams' bodygraph.svg with all new features
- All changes pushed to humandesign_api and VibologyOS repositories

**2026-01-28 (AM):** Human Design API bodygraph renderer improvements
- Replaced PNG triangle images with native SVG paths for exaltation/detriment symbols
- Fixed triangle vertical centering (separate viewBox dimensions for each triangle type)
- Implemented width compensation for equal border padding (exaltation vs detriment)
- Fixed critical API bug: `int(hours)` → `float(hours)` causing incorrect moon calculations
- Triangles now render at 8pt with proper positioning (10px from visible panel borders)
- Documented Gate 23.4 detriment discrepancy in EXALTATION_ERRATA.md

**2026-01-27:** Major repository cleanup and health assessment
- Comprehensive library audit (747 files, 99.9% cross-refs, 0 dead links)
- Deleted 33 temp scripts from root
- Archived 34 maintenance scripts from System/Scripts
- Archived completed plans and abandoned audits
- Updated CLAUDE.md to V4.4
- Relocated Consultations to ~/Business/
- Fresh NEXT.md (archived 64KB historical version)
