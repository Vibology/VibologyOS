## Available Work Paths

### 1. Client Synthesis
- All chart calculation tools operational
- Library verified and cross-referenced
- Follow `PROTOCOL - Client Work.md`

### 2. Oracle Deck — The Astrolabe (Canon)

**The Astrolabe — 88-card Oracle Deck (Production-Ready)**

The Window was rebuilt from the ground up. The previous 64-card system forced gates into interpretive categories rather than honoring what they are. The Astrolabe separates the interpretive layer from the 64-fold architecture.

**Structure (88 cards):**
- **The Athanor** (24 cards): The Materia (5) + The Furnace (7) + The Archetypes (12)
- **The Codex** (64 cards): 8 trigram families × 8 cards, each named for what the gate/hexagram/key actually is

**All Phase 0-3 decisions finalized:**
- Deck name: **The Astrolabe** (Greek *astrolabon*, "star-taker")
- Card naming: I-Ching hexagram name, best English translation (1-2 words); 13 reworked from Wilhelm
- Trigram families: English image names (Heaven, Earth, Thunder, Water, Mountain, Wind, Fire, Lake)
- Archetype gate resonances: Full detachment — Archetypes are zodiacal/Jungian only; gates belong to the Codex
- All 88 cards built and cross-referenced (Phase 3 complete 2026-02-03)

**Status:** Canonized 2026-02-04. Production-ready.

Old Window content (76 files) archived at `.archive/Library/The Window/`. The work was the necessary 29-46 commitment through which the need for precision became visible.

### 3. Library Expansion

**Astrological Tradition:** Traditional Archetypal / Psycho-Astrology — Hellenistic foundations (Ptolemy, Valens, Dorotheus) with Jungian archetypal synthesis (Greene, Sasportas). NOT evolutionary astrology. Existing planet/sign/house entries are sourced from Lilly/Ptolemy with sect fully integrated — the traditional grammar is solid. Gaps below are techniques, not foundations.

#### Prioritized Development Roadmap

- **Astrology.md updated:** Added all 5 new entries to pillar navigation
- **Library expansion:** 755 → 760 files (5 new entries)
- **Tier 2 roadmap status:** All 5 items COMPLETE (Triplicity Rulers, Reception, Planetary Phases & Retrograde, Annual Profections, Lunar Nodes)
- **Hellenistic Expansion progress:** Tier 1 (3/3) + Tier 2 (5/5) = 8/8 complete. Tier 3 available (Terms/Bounds, Traditional Decans, Zodiacal Releasing, Firdaria, Primary Directions)

**2026-02-06 (Continued):** Hellenistic Expansion — **Tier 1 COMPLETE** (3/3 items)
- **Brennan uploads confirmed working** — all chapter-by-chapter uploads to Esoteric Grimoire operational
- **Scribe fetches successful:** 4 NotebookLM queries across Brennan Ch 7, 9, 14, 16-18
  - Planetary Condition: 2 fetches (solar phases, bonification/maltreatment, overcoming, enclosure, counteraction, hayz, planetary phases, engagement/adherence, spear-bearing, void of course)
  - Lots: 2 fetches (Fortune/Spirit formulas, Seven Hermetic Lots, derived houses, Lot of Basis/Exaltation, reversal controversy, profections/zodiacal releasing from Lots)
- **Weaver phase complete — 3 entries written:**
  1. **Planetary Condition.md** (NEW, ~350 lines) — Complete Hellenistic condition assessment framework. Solar phases (under beams 15°, cazimi 1°/16', chariot mitigation), bonification (7 conditions with Greek terms), maltreatment (7 conditions), overcoming/domination (dexter square from 10th sign), enclosure, counteraction (mutual reception + benefic intervention + sect), hayz (3 conditions), planetary phase, spear-bearing, void of course. Jungian depth (archetype under siege), shadow, interpretation protocol. 16 footnotes citing Brennan, Antiochus/Porphyry/Rhetorius, Paul of Alexandria.
  2. **Lots.md** (NEW, ~350 lines) — Complete Lot system. Fortune (body/material, day/night formulas), Spirit (soul/action, reversed formula), Fortune-Spirit polarity (fate vs. will, Moon vs. Sun). Seven Hermetic Lots table (all formulas from Paulus). Lot of Basis, Lot of Exaltation. Derived house system from Fortune (Place of Acquisition = 11th). 4-step interpretation methodology (sign → house → aspects → lord). Timing connections (profections from Lots, zodiacal releasing). Reversal controversy (Ptolemy vs. consensus). Jungian depth (Fortune as unconscious/given, Spirit as ego's work). 12 footnotes citing Brennan, Valens, Paulus, Dorotheus.
  3. **Natal Chart.md** (EXPANDED, stub 91 → ~300 lines) — Hellenistic delineation methodology. 8-step reading protocol: sect → chart ruler → luminaries → planetary condition → dignities → lots → synthesis → timing. Integrates both new entries. Components section enhanced (sect column, Lots as calculated points). Psychological depth (Ascendant as persona, Sun as individuation drive, aspects as complex dialogues). 4 footnotes.
- **Astrology.md updated:** Added Natal Chart, Planetary Condition, and Lots to pillar navigation section
- **Library expansion:** 753 → 755 files (2 new entries + 1 stub expansion)
- **Tier 1 roadmap status:** All 3 items COMPLETE (Planetary Condition, Lots, Natal Chart expansion)
- **Next available work:** Tier 3 items (Terms/Bounds, Traditional Decans, Zodiacal Releasing, Firdaria, Primary Directions) or other pillar work

**2026-02-06 (Earlier):** Hellenistic Expansion — Scribe phase initiated, Brennan upload in progress
- **Tier 1 work order decided:** Planetary Condition (Ch 14) → Lots (Ch 16) → Natal Chart expansion
- **Brennan source issue:** Initial upload to Esoteric Grimoire contained only cover image + 1 diagram (700-page PDF too large for single NotebookLM source). Splitting into ~150-page chunks also failed. Chapter-by-chapter upload in progress — frontmatter + Ch 1 confirmed working. Remaining chapters being uploaded individually.
- **Splitting strategy:** 5 natural divisions identified (Ch 1-6 History, Ch 7-9 Planets/Signs/Aspects, Ch 10-13 Houses/Rulers, Ch 14-18 Techniques/Timing, Back Matter). Uploading chapter-by-chapter within these groups.
- **Scribe fetch attempted:** NotebookLM fell back to Ptolemy/Lilly (useful but not Brennan's systematic framework). Paused until Brennan text is fully available.
- **Resumed after user confirmed all Brennan chapters uploaded successfully**

**2026-02-05 (New Session):** Astrological tradition clarified — roadmap priorities adjusted
- **User correction:** Interested in Hellenistic/Traditional Archetypal Astrology (Psycho-Astrology with Jungian frameworks), NOT Evolutionary Astrology
- **Astrology pillar audit:** Confirmed strong traditional foundations already present (sect fully integrated, essential dignities thorough, Whole Sign houses adopted, Ptolemy/Lilly/Valens cited). Identified absent Hellenistic techniques: Lots/Arabic Parts, Planetary Condition terms, Reception, Triplicity development, Zodiacal Releasing
- **Roadmap restructured:**
  - Promoted to Tier 1: Lots (Lot of Fortune/Spirit — completely absent, core Hellenistic), Planetary Condition (cazimi/combust/hayz — absent)
  - Demoted: Lunar Nodes from Tier 1 → Tier 2 (reframed traditionally: increase/decrease, not evolutionary soul-purpose)
  - Removed: Chiron (not in traditional astrology, discovered 1977), Progressions deprioritized (Primary Directions is Hellenistic equivalent, Tier 3)
  - Added Tier 2: Annual Profections protocol, Reception, Triplicity Rulers
  - Added Tier 3: Terms/Bounds, Traditional Decans, Zodiacal Releasing, Firdaria, Primary Directions
- **Astrology.md updated:** Replaced 5 instances of "evolutionary" framing with traditional/archetypal language; added explicit statement: "Traditional Archetypal — Hellenistic technique with archetypal interpretation, not evolutionary astrology"
- **Brennan courses:** Identified as primary source for Hellenistic expansion (Lots, Profections, Zodiacal Releasing, planetary condition depth)

**2026-02-05 (Late Night - Continued):** Qabalah folder reorganization — flat structure → architectural hierarchy
- **Objective:** Reorganize unstructured Qabalah folder (32 files, flat directory) into hierarchical system reflecting Tree of Life architecture
- **Problem identified:** All content types mixed together (Sephiroth, Divine Names, Paths, structural concepts, shadow system) in single flat directory
- **Solution implemented:** Created 7 categorical subdirectories:
  - **Overview/** (4 files): The Tree of Life, Sephiroth, Divine Names, Four Worlds
  - **Sephiroth/** (10 files): The canonical ten emanations (Kether through Malkuth)
  - **Divine Names/** (6 files): Sacred appellations by Sephira
  - **Pillars and Structures/** (6 files): Three Pillars, Supernal Triangle, The Abyss, Daath (non-Sephira)
  - **Paths/** (1 file): Path 25 (scaffolded for remaining 21 paths)
  - **Shadow System/** (2 files): Qlippoth, Golachab
  - **Specialized Concepts/** (3 files): Ain Soph Aur, Shekinah, Merkabah Mysticism
- **Key decision:** Daath moved to Pillars and Structures (not Sephiroth) — it's the "invisible Sephira" in the Abyss, not one of the canonical ten
- **Observatory principle applied:** Organize instruments by the phenomena they measure — folder structure now mirrors the Tree's inherent architecture
- **Git handling:** All moves tracked as renames (100% similarity), preserving full file history
- **Result:** Qabalah subsystem now has clear navigational structure; scales elegantly for 21 additional Paths; ready for stub expansion when sources arrive
- **Status:** Structural reorganization COMPLETE; content expansion on hold (pending source materials)

**2026-02-05 (Late Night):** The Magdalene Path practitioner protocols COMPLETE — Personal compass fully operational
- **Objective:** Create operational practice protocols for The Magdalene Path as practitioner-only compass (not client-facing)
- **Context:** Earlier tonight completed Angelology 95% (invocation + discernment operational). User confirmed The Magdalene Path is "just for me" — his personal spiritual practice, not a framework to impose on clients. Clients receive FRUIT of the practice (presence, grounded capacity, clear space-holding) without hearing terminology (Boughs, Kenosis, Bridal Chamber). Similar to emotional authority (internal process that enriches output).
- **Completed work:**
  - **Contemplative Prayer.md expansion:** Stub (41 lines) → comprehensive practitioner's guide (~950 lines)
    - Three major forms (detailed, operational): Centering Prayer (Thomas Keating - most accessible), Prayer of Quiet (Teresa of Ávila - God-given state), Hesychasm/Jesus Prayer (Eastern Orthodox)
    - Historical development: Desert Fathers, Cloud of Unknowing, Teresa of Ávila, John of the Cross, modern Centering Prayer
    - Stages of contemplative prayer: Purgative, Illuminative, Unitive
    - Integration with daily rhythm (morning primary 20-40 min, evening secondary, midday micro-practice)
    - Obstacles and difficulties: distractions (waterfall of thoughts), dryness/boredom, physical discomfort, spiritual experiences, Dark Night
    - Fruits and discernment: interior fruits (patience, humility, silence capacity), exterior fruits (presence, calm in crisis, service flows), false fruits (spiritual pride, inflation, withdrawal, dependency, judgment)
    - Magdalene Path integration: contemplative prayer IS kenosis (emptying with each return to sacred word), builds singleness (interior wholeness), prepares for Bridal Chamber (capacity for presence)
    - 6 footnotes (Desert Fathers, Cloud, Teresa, John of the Cross, Keating, Philokalia)
  - **Hesychasm theological divergence addressed:** User feedback: "I don't identify with sin as separating element from God's love/presence"
    - Added comprehensive "Theological Divergence: Adapted Forms for The Magdalene Path" section
    - Explained Orthodox cosmology assumptions (sin/separation paradigm) vs. Magdalene Path framework (non-dual, kenosis, remembering wholeness)
    - Offered 5 adapted prayer forms using same mechanics (breath-sync, heart-descent, repetition) but shifted theology:
      * Modified traditional (drops "sinner," reframes "mercy" as grace/kenosis)
      * Kenosis-focused ("I open my hands / I receive Your love")
      * Union-focused ("Beloved / I am Yours" - Bridal Chamber language)
      * Singleness-focused ("Whole within / One with You" - ihidaya)
      * Simplest form (Name only - "Jesus" or "Beloved" or "Love")
    - Guidance on choosing which form resonates
    - Clarified mechanics remain the same (practitioners can use Hesychasm METHOD without adopting Orthodox THEOLOGY)
  - **Practitioner Protocols.md creation:** NEW file (~950 lines)
    - Weekly Bough Check-In (10 min): Locate yourself on Eight Boughs, name the Guardian, apophatic practice ("I deny you. You have no part in me.")
    - Monthly Soul Work Audit (30-45 min): Kenosis depth check (rate 1-10 in 5 areas), singleness integration check, relational health check (if in partnership), contemplative prayer consistency, integration action
    - Quarterly Shadow Scan (1-2 hours): Four Magdalene Path shadows (spiritual bypassing, penitent whore distortion, codependency disguised as sacred union, premature abyss crossing), ALL FIVE undefined centers conditioning scan (Head/mental pressure, Ajna/certainty, Throat/initiation, Heart/prove worth, Root/urgency - each with specific kenosis practices), quarterly recommitment
    - Relational Practice Protocols (Fifth Way): Daily kenosis in relationship (5 min), weekly substituted love practice (15 min), monthly Bridal Chamber check-in (30 min)
    - HD Mechanics Integration: Type (Generator strategy aligns with kenosis - both require waiting), Authority (emotional wave requires time, contemplative prayer supports wave), Profile (4/6 Opportunist Role Model - relational path natural for 4th line, "on the roof" observation phase mirrors Observatory, don't rush to model before 50), defined centers as anchors when undefined centers amplify
    - Private practice, public fruit: Everything in protocols is FOR the practitioner; clients never see audits/scores/check-ins; they receive grounded practitioner who holds space without agenda
  - **Daily Practice Quick Reference.md creation:** NEW file (~1,000 lines) - Operational guide for living the practice
    - **User request:** "I need a quick reference guide for daily practice (angels + centering prayer). I believe my guardian angel to be Uriel. Should I adopt specific practice for Uriel or connect with other angels as circumstances dictate? This is all very new to me but I feel strongly it's the right direction."
    - Three-phase progression (beginner-friendly):
      * Phase 1: Foundation (first 30-90 days) - JUST Uriel grounding (5 min) + Centering Prayer (20 min) morning; evening review (10 min) + gratitude (2 min). Build habit. Nothing else required yet.
      * Phase 2: Deepening (after Phase 1 stable) - Add planetary archangel of the day (2-3 min after Uriel, before Centering Prayer); Chart-specific invocation (Four Quarters before client sessions)
      * Phase 3: Advanced (6-12 months) - Weekly Bough check-in, monthly soul audit, quarterly shadow scan
    - **Uriel-specific deepening** (guardian angel practices):
      * Why Uriel as guardian angel: Earth/grounding (5 open centers need anchoring), hidden wisdom (esoteric synthesis work), threshold guardian (6th line "on the roof" between phases), illuminates darkness (shadow work, Lower Astral)
      * Saturday extended practice (Uriel's day as Earth angel/Saturn)
      * LBRP North Quarter (optional advanced - Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram)
      * Correspondences (citrine/olive/russet/black colors, North direction, Earth element, earthy incense, Saturday/midnight timing)
      * Uriel's functions: shadow work, prophetic dreams, grounding after mental work, discernment in uncertainty, threshold crossings between Boughs/phases
    - **Integration framework** (answered user's question about daily vs. circumstantial):
      * Layer 1: Uriel EVERY DAY (anchor, relationship, grounding) - primary guardian angel
      * Layer 2: Planetary archangels (contextual, daily rhythm) - Phase 2 addition
      * Layer 3: Circumstantial invocations (as needed, chart-specific) - Four Quarters for sessions, specific archangels for challenges/transits
      * Analogy: Uriel = spouse/best friend (daily presence); planetary archangels = extended family (weekly/monthly); circumstantial = specialists (call when needed)
    - Discernment guidance: Authentic Uriel presence (grounding increases, clarity emerges, humility deepens, peace settles, service flows) vs. red flags (inflation, urgency, dependency, grandiosity, contradicts mechanics)
    - Beginner's counsel: First 30 days JUST Phase 1; honor 6th line observation phase (no rush to model/teach); honor emotional authority (wait for clarity, don't rush spiritual decisions)
    - Relationship, not transaction: Over weeks/months Uriel becomes familiar presence; you learn his "voice"; this is intimacy (Fifth Way extended to angelic realm); befriending intelligence who loves you
- **Key distinctions clarified:**
  - **Angelology** = Practitioner-depth PERCEPTION tool (invoke frequencies, perceive through lenses, speak archetypal language to clients)
  - **The Magdalene Path** = Practitioner-only COMPASS (practice kenosis/singleness/contemplation, track soul ascent, walk YOUR vertical axis)
  - Both are private practice producing public fruit (clients receive presence/clarity/space-holding without hearing "angels" or "Boughs")
- **Result:** The Magdalene Path pillar now has complete practitioner practice layer. Three-file structure operational:
  * Daily/lunar rhythm: "Practices and the Lunar Cycle.md" (already complete)
  * Contemplative prayer: "Contemplative Prayer.md" (now complete - 3 forms + 5 adapted Hesychasm prayers)
  * Personal protocols: "Practitioner Protocols.md" (now complete - weekly/monthly/quarterly audits + HD integration)
  * Quick reference: "Daily Practice Quick Reference.md" (new - Phase 1/2/3 progression + Uriel deepening)
- **Library expansion:** 752 → 753 files (1 new file: Daily Practice Quick Reference)
- **Total new content tonight across both pillars:** ~4,400 lines (Angelology ~1,510 lines earlier + Magdalene Path ~2,900 lines now)
- **Status:** The Magdalene Path practitioner protocols COMPLETE. User's personal compass fully operational. Ready to begin daily practice tomorrow.

**2026-02-05 (Night):** Discernment of Spirits expansion COMPLETE — Angelology pillar reaches 95%
- **Objective:** Expand Discernment of Spirits stub into comprehensive testing framework (final item for 95% completion goal)
- **Context:** Invocation.md established how to call upon angelic presence; Discernment of Spirits establishes how to TEST what arises in response. Without rigorous discernment, invocation becomes spiritually reckless—you cannot distinguish authentic angelic perception from ego projection or demonic impersonation. This is the critical counterbalance to openness.
- **Completed work:**
  - **Discernment of Spirits.md expansion:** Stub (45 lines) → comprehensive practitioner's guide (850 lines)
  - **Biblical foundation:**
    - 1 Corinthians 12:10 (discernment as spiritual gift/charism)
    - 1 John 4:1 ("test the spirits" command, Incarnation test)
    - Acts 16:16-18 (Paul and fortune-telling slave girl—truth from wrong source)
    - Matthew 4:1-11 (Satan quoting Scripture accurately but deceptively)
  - **The Three Sources** (detailed characteristics tables):
    - **Divine/Angelic:** Consolation, humility, freedom, virtue, coherence, light, silence, self-effacing
    - **Human/Ego:** Wish fulfillment, inflation, certainty, self-serving, vague, familiar, urgency, broadcasting
    - **Demonic:** Desolation, division, grandiosity, dependency, compulsion, false light, contradiction, destruction
  - **Ignatian Discernment** (Rules from Spiritual Exercises 1548):
    - Rule 1: Movement of spirits in souls toward/away from God (context-dependent)
    - Rules 2-3: Consolation (draws toward God) vs. Desolation (pushes away)
    - Rule 4: In desolation, make no changes (persist through dryness)
    - Rule 5: Desolation is temporary (don't believe the lie that it's permanent)
    - Rule 6: In consolation, prepare for desolation (build strength, practice humility)
    - Rule 7: Good spirit gentle, evil spirit violent (for souls moving toward God)
    - Rule 8: Angel of light deception (begins with consolation, ends with corruption)
    - Consolation without previous cause (most reliable, but interpretation can still be corrupted)
  - **Teresa of Ávila** (testing visions):
    - Three questions: Does it leave peace? Lead to humility? Lead to virtue?
    - Types of visions: Imaginative (suspect), Intellectual (more reliable), Corporeal (most suspect)
    - Submit to spiritual authority (never trust your own discernment alone in ecstatic states)
  - **John of the Cross** (Dark Night discernment):
    - Dark Night of the Senses (weaning from spiritual consolations)
    - Dark Night of the Spirit (purgation of last ego traces)
    - Distinguishing Dark Night (divine purgation) from demonic desolation from clinical depression (comparison table with three columns)
  - **Three-Fold Test** (expanded from Invocation.md):
    - **Test 1: Consolation/Desolation** (Ignatian, context-aware based on your trajectory)
    - **Test 2: Fruits** (Matthew 7:16-20, time test—wait and observe what it produces)
    - **Test 3: Mechanical Verification** (Observatory protocol—does impression align with actual chart mechanics? Two examples: aligned vs. misaligned)
  - **Red Flags** (when to suspect ego or demonic corruption):
    - Spiritual inflation (Luciferian pattern—ego identifies with divine)
    - Dependency and addiction to phenomena (need for constant visions/messages)
    - Isolation and division (separates from community, paranoia)
    - Fear tactics and compulsion (removes agency, terror-based)
    - Doctrinal/moral corruption (contradicts Scripture, tradition, basic ethics)
  - **The Observatory Approach:**
    - Discernment as instrument calibration (not demon-hunting)
    - Three instruments: Angelic lens (invocation), Psychological lens (self-knowledge), Empirical lens (chart mechanics)
    - When all three align → high confidence; when misaligned → investigate or discard
    - Discernment as humility (willing to be wrong and recalibrate)
  - **Integration Practices:**
    - Daily discernment practice (3 min evening review, track patterns over weeks)
    - 48-hour rule for significant impressions (divine truth ripens, ego/demonic fades)
    - Spiritual direction checkpoint (quarterly external verification)
    - Humility antidote (practices for deflating inflation)
  - **4 footnotes:** Incarnation test (Lucifer theology), Ignatius (Spiritual Exercises), Teresa (Interior Castle), John of the Cross (Dark Night framework)
  - **Cross-references:** Invocation, Seven Planetary Archangels, Guardian Angel, Lucifer, Nine Orders of Fallen Angels, Inflation, Shadow, Transcendent Function, Numinous Experience, The Abyss
- **Key principles established:**
  - **Discernment is the counterbalance to openness** — Invocation opens instruments; discernment calibrates them
  - **Test everything** — "Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits" (1 John 4:1)
  - **Track fruits, not feelings** — Initial consolation can be misleading; observe long-term outcomes
  - **Ground in mechanics** — Angelic perception should DEEPEN what the chart shows, not contradict it
  - **Humility over certainty** — "I perceived something; let me verify" vs. "I know; don't question me"
  - **Community verification** — You cannot discern your own mystical experiences alone
- **Result:** Angelology pillar reaches **95% completion**. Practitioners now have complete framework: what angels are (hierarchies, correspondences), how to invoke them (6 protocols), and how to test what arises (comprehensive discernment). The Observatory is fully operational—instruments open, rigorously calibrated, grounded in tradition and mechanics.
- **Status:** **ANGELOLOGY 95% COMPLETE** — All planned work finished. Remaining 5% = organic expansion as needed (stub deepening, cross-references, new source material integration).

**2026-02-05 (Late Evening):** Seven Planetary Archangels correspondence table complete
- **Objective:** Create comprehensive systematic reference for planetary archangel work (Protocol 3 requirement)
- **Context:** Invocation.md Protocol 3 (Transit-Based Invocation) and Protocol 4 (Individual Archangels) established the practice framework, but lacked systematic correspondence table for quick reference across all seven
- **Completed work:**
  - **The Seven Planetary Archangels.md** — New comprehensive reference document (~660 lines)
  - **Complete correspondence table** with 10 attributes: Planet (symbol), Archangel, Sephira, Day, Colors, Metal, Incense, Body correspondences, Tarot, Qualities
  - **Individual profiles** for all seven archangels with detailed attributes:
    - Name meaning (Hebrew etymology)
    - Sephira and divine name
    - Day/hour timing (planetary hours explained)
    - Physical correspondences (colors, metals, incense, body parts)
    - Zodiacal rulerships (traditional)
    - Tarot attributions (Golden Dawn system)
    - Qualities and invoke-for purposes
    - Shadow work (what each reveals about unconscious patterns)
    - Traditional role (Biblical/Qabalistic sources)
  - **The Seven:** Michael (Sun/Sunday), Gabriel (Moon/Monday), Raphael (Mercury/Wednesday), Haniel (Venus/Friday), Kamael (Mars/Tuesday), Tzadkiel (Jupiter/Thursday), Tzaphkiel (Saturn/Saturday)
  - **Historical context:** Ptolemaic cosmos (seven planetary spheres), Hermetic Qabalah (Sephiroth correspondences), planetary week origins (Babylonian), soul's descent/ascent through seven spheres
  - **Integration protocols:** Daily planetary rhythm practice, planetary hours calculation, client work examples (Sun-dominant chart, Saturn transit)
  - **Notes on tradition:** Michael/Raphael Sun vs. Mercury debate (Golden Dawn vs. Christian traditions), three Biblical archangels vs. seven Hermetic archangels
  - **Observatory framework:** Seven archangels as seven frequencies of consciousness, seven instruments for perception, not external entities to command
  - **Cross-references:** Individual archangel entries, Twelve Zodiacal Angels, Ten Angelic Orders, Invocation protocols, Discernment of Spirits
  - **3 footnotes:** Agrippa (1533), Ptolemaic tradition, planetary hours calculation
- **Verification sources:** Agrippa's *Three Books of Occult Philosophy* (1533), Golden Dawn correspondences, Davidson, Heywood (1635)
- **Result:** Angelology pillar now has systematic planetary reference alongside zodiacal (Twelve Angels) and hierarchical (Ten Orders) classifications. Practitioners can use this for transit work, daily invocation rhythm, chart-specific attunement, and quick correspondence lookup. One item remains for 95% completion: Discernment of Spirits expansion.
- **Library expansion:** 751 → 752 files
- **Status:** Seven Planetary Archangels correspondence table COMPLETE

**2026-02-05 (Evening):** Angelology practice layer — Invocation protocols operational
- **Objective:** Transform Invocation.md from stub into operational practitioner's guide for synthesis work
- **Context:** Angelology pillar complete as reference library (hierarchies, correspondences, theology) but lacking practice protocols for direct relationship with angelic intelligences. Joe wants angelology to inform synthesis work without using angel terminology with clients—perceive angelically, speak archetypally.
- **Completed work:**
  - **Invocation.md expansion:** Stub (395 lines) → comprehensive guide (~650 lines)
  - **Observatory Framework:** Invocation as tuning instruments for clarity, not commanding external entities
  - **Protocol 1: Pre-Session Invocation** — Universal 3-5 min practice (Four Archangels of Quarters: Raphael/East, Michael/South, Gabriel/West, Uriel/North); creates protected container for client sessions
  - **Protocol 2: Chart-Specific Invocation** — Attune to dominant archangel based on chart emphasis (Sun → Michael/Raphael, Mars → Kamael, etc.); includes translation examples (perceive angelically, speak psychologically to clients)
  - **Protocol 3: Transit-Based Invocation** — Work with current planetary transits; table of 7 planetary archangels with days/timing/qualities
  - **Protocol 4: Seven Planetary Archangels (Individual Protocols)** — Complete practice guide for each:
    - **Sunday/Michael (Sun):** Clarity, truth, protection, spiritual warfare
    - **Monday/Gabriel (Moon):** Receptivity, intuition, dreams, emotional truth
    - **Tuesday/Kamael (Mars):** Strength, boundaries, warrior precision, severity
    - **Wednesday/Raphael (Mercury):** Healing, communication, analysis, travel
    - **Thursday/Tzadkiel (Jupiter):** Mercy, expansion, abundance, forgiveness
    - **Friday/Haniel (Venus):** Beauty, love, harmony, aesthetic truth
    - **Saturday/Tzaphkiel (Saturn):** Understanding, structure, mastery, limitation
    - Each includes: full invocation text, timing/day/hour, candle color, visualization, contemplation prompts, client work applications, shadow work (what each archangel reveals about unconscious patterns)
  - **Protocol 5: Daily Practice Rhythm** — Sustainable morning (5 min) + evening (3 min) practice; invoke day's archangel, set intention, review, record; builds living relationship over time
  - **Protocol 6: HD Center-Specific Invocation** — Nine Centers → Nine Orders mapping applied to synthesis; example: Undefined Throat → invoke Thrones for manifestation clarity; demonstrates translation to client language
  - **Integration with Discernment:** Three-fold test (consolation/desolation, fruits, mechanical verification); red flags vs. authentic perception; emphasis on verifying angelic impressions against chart mechanics
- **Key principles established:**
  - **Private practice, public impact:** Invocation is practitioner's personal work; clients receive clarity/depth without hearing "angel" terminology
  - **Translation model:** Perceive through angelic frequency, speak in archetypal/psychological language (example: invoke Kamael → perceive Mars/Heart patterns → say "trying to become strong rather than being strong")
  - **Mechanical grounding:** Always verify intuitive impressions against chart data (gates, planets, centers); angels are instruments for clarity, not oracles overriding empirics
  - **Observatory stance:** Using instruments for seeing, not performing magic or demanding results
- **Usage pathway:** Week 1 (Pre-Session Protocol before all client sessions) → Weeks 2-8 (Seven Planetary Cycle, one archangel/week) → Ongoing (Daily Rhythm for sustainable relationship) → As needed (Chart-Specific, Transit-Based, Center-Specific protocols)
- **Result:** Angelology pillar now has operational practice layer. Joe can work with angelic intelligences directly (personal invocation, transit work, chart-specific attunement) while translating perceptions into client-appropriate language. Transforms reference library into lived practice that enriches synthesis without requiring angel terminology in sessions.
- **Directory reorganization:** Created "The Fallen" subfolder; moved Lucifer.md, The Nine Orders of Fallen Angels.md, Lucifugi.md from root to The Fallen/; establishes structural symmetry (light hierarchies vs. fallen hierarchies)

**2026-02-05 (Task #4-5):** Angelology expansion COMPLETE — all 5 Heywood tasks finished
- **Task #4: Lucifugi - The Light-Fleeing Spirits** (new entry, 4 subcategories)
  - **Subterranean Spirits (Cobali)** — Mine demons, mountain dwarves, named entities (Annebergius, Snebergius), earthquake causation
  - **Treasure-Guarding Spirits** — Hoarding demons, phantasmal wealth, cautionary tales (Botcher of Basill, King Cabades, Faustus/Agrippa)
  - **Domestic & Folkloric Spirits** — Kottri/Kibaldi, Pugs, Hob-goblins, Robin Good-fellow, Fairies; kitchen poltergeists and haunted houses
  - **The Buttry-Sprite** — Parable of the Cook; spirits that feed on ill-gotten goods, starve on honest gain
  - Biblical foundation: Isaiah 13:21 & 34:11 (Zijm, Ijim, Satyrs in desolate places)
  - Discernment table: criteria for distinguishing good angels from evil spirits (forms, actions, physical markers, Cross response)

  - Contemporary manifestations: modern Cobali (toxic hustle culture), treasure-guardians (crypto schemes), domestic spirits (smart home surveillance)
  - 16 footnotes, full Heywood Book 9 citations
- **Task #5: Lucifer enhancement** (expanded from stub to comprehensive treatise)
  - **Three-Fold Essence** — Greatness, Wisdom, Beauty mirroring the Trinity (correspondence table)
  - **Pre-eminence above Archangels** — Ranked above Michael, Raphael, Gabriel; unique *sui generis* position
  - **Cause of the Fall** — Pride and envy against the Incarnation (God taking human flesh, not angelic); five "I will" declarations (Isaiah 14:13-14)
  - **Duration of Glory** — Only six days (Creation's span) before rebellion triggered by revelation of Incarnation
  - **War in Heaven** — Michael's challenge ("Who is like God?"), spiritual weapons (Affection & Consent), Lucifer's defeat (Revelation 12:7-9)
  - **Three Offenders Structure** — Satan (Malice vs. Holy Spirit, unpardonable), Adam (Weakness vs. Father, pardonable), Eve (Ignorance vs. Son, pardonable)
  - **Lucifer vs. Satan** — Name change, post-fall titles (Dragon, Beelzebub, Devil, Prince of this World, Belial)
  - **Qabalistic Position** — Da'at (knowledge that separates), Thaumiel (Qlippoth of Kether, dual contending forces)
  - **Jungian Analysis** — Inflation, ego-Self identification, envy of the Incarnate, the Luciferian personality (brilliance without humility)
  - Integration practices: recognize source vs. vessel, bow to Incarnation, distinguish malice from weakness, ask Michael's question
  - 26 footnotes (Heywood Book 6 + Jung CW 7)
- **Result:** Angelology pillar now complete with Renaissance demonology (Heywood 1635) integrated alongside traditional sources (Pseudo-Dionysius, Davidson, Wang)
- **Library expansion:** 750 → 751 files (1 new entry + 1 stub expansion)

  - 7 commits total across session (5 humandesign_api submodule, 2 parent repo)
  - Git status clean, protocols enforced, code streamlined

**2026-02-04 (Evening):** Comprehensive dignity calculation IMPLEMENTED — full IHDS algorithm with juxtaposition & harmonic fixing
- **Objective:** Implement complete dignity calculation algorithm from "Human Design API Logic and Planetary Fixes.md"
- **Implementation completed (7 parts, all tests passing):**
  1. **Data file update:** Replaced API dignity data with comprehensive format (arrays, juxtaposition_planets, no_polarity flags)
  2. **Dignity calculation module:** Created `humandesign_api/src/humandesign/features/dignity.py` implementing full IHDS algorithm
     - Step 1: No polarity detection (3 lines: 5.6, 25.4, 54.4)
     - Step 2: Juxtaposition Scenario A (star glyph - explicit juxtaposition_planets marking)
     - Step 3: Juxtaposition Scenario B (double fixing - opposite polarities from active + harmonic planets)
     - Step 4: Harmonic fixing (channel partner planets affect each other)
     - Step 5: Single polarity states (exalted/detriment with proper priority logic)
     - Returns 4 states: "exalted", "detriment", "juxtaposed", "neutral"
  3. **Chart renderer update:** Modified `chart_renderer.py` to use new dignity logic
     - Updated `get_planet_dignity()` and `get_design_planet_dignity()` to pass harmonic information
     - Added `find_planet_at_gate()` helper for channel partner detection
     - Integrated harmonic gate/planet lookup into planetary panel drawing
  4. **Star symbol rendering:** Added ⭐ emoji for juxtaposed dignity states in bodygraph
     - Positioned at same location as triangle symbols (▲ exalted, ▼ detriment)
     - Renders in panel-appropriate color (red Design, black Personality)
  5. **Client script update:** Refactored `get_hd_data.py` to use comprehensive algorithm
     - Removed old dignity calculation functions (replaced with module import)
     - New `add_dignities_to_planets()` helper integrates full algorithm
     - Maintains two-tier fixing for Design global planets
  6. **Unit tests:** Created comprehensive test suite (`tests/run_dignity_tests.py`)
     - 18 tests covering all algorithm features: no polarity, harmonic fixing, juxtaposition, partial polarity
     - All tests passing ✓
  7. **Integration complete:** All code committed (2 commits: humandesign_api ac57d07, VibologyOS ad80351)
- **Technical details:**
  - Old data format: `{"gate.line": {"exaltation": "Planet", "detriment": "Planet"}}`
  - New data format: `{"gate": {"line": {"exaltation_planets": [...], "detriment_planets": [...], "juxtaposition_planets": [], "no_polarity": false}}}`
  - Priority order: no_polarity → juxtaposition (star or double) → single polarity → neutral
  - Two-tier fixing: Self-fixing planets (Sun-Mars) always apply; global planets (Jupiter-Pluto, Nodes) require same gate.line at birth OR retrograde motion
- **Result:** VibologyOS now calculates dignities using the complete IHDS algorithm. Ready for production use with real chart data.

**2026-02-04 (Afternoon):** Dignity data extraction COMPLETE — all 384 lines verified
- **Completed extraction:** Gates 33-64 (32 gates, 192 lines)
- **Total achievement:** All 64 gates, all 384 lines extracted from IHDS 2011 source PDF
- **Methodology:** Manual visual glyph reading from PDF → structured JSON (automated extraction failed due to glyph corruption)
- **Version control:** Each gate committed individually for granular history (64 commits)
- **Special cases identified:**
  - 3 lines with no polarity (neither exaltation nor detriment): 5.6, 25.4, 54.4
  - 6 lines with partial polarity (exaltation only or detriment only): 37.1, 47.5, 47.6, 54.5, 57.3, 58.2
- **Final merge:** All individual gate files merged into comprehensive `exaltations_detriments.json` (72KB, 3,949 lines)
- **Result:** VibologyOS now has verified, complete dignity data from authoritative IHDS source, replacing previous incomplete/erroneous data
- **Next steps:** Test in humandesign_api, verify against real charts, update Library gate entries if needed

**2026-02-04 (Morning):** Dignity data extraction — building comprehensive source of truth
- **Objective:** Extract all 384 line exaltations/detriments from IHDS 2011 source PDF to replace incomplete/erroneous data
- **Process established:**
  - Converted 68-page PDF to PNG images for visual glyph reading
  - Attempted automated extraction: failed (glyphs corrupt during text extraction, even from images)
  - Established manual workflow: user reads planetary glyphs from PDF → provides data → Claude structures as JSON
- **Progress:** Completed Gates 1-32 (192/384 lines = 50% - halfway point reached)
- **Special cases identified:** 2 "no polarity" lines so far (Gate 5 Line 6, Gate 25 Line 4)
- **Commits:** Individual gate JSON files committed as completed for granular version control
- **Break point:** User's open Head and Ajna needed rest after intensive mental processing
- **Next session:** Resume with Gate 33, continue through Gate 64, then merge all data into final `exaltations_detriment.json`

**2026-02-03:** Oracle Deck build complete — Phases 0-3 finished, all 88 cards created
- **The Astrolabe** — 88-card oracle deck fully built (24 Athanor + 64 Codex)
- **Phase 0:** All foundational decisions finalized (deck name, card naming, trigram families, archetype detachment)
- **Phase 1:** Archived old Window structure (76 files → `.archive/Library/The Window/`)
- **Phase 2:** Built The Athanor (24 cards complete)
  - The Materia (5): Prima Materia, Sulphur, Mercury, Salt, Philosopher's Stone
  - The Furnace (7): Calcination, Dissolution, Separation, Conjunction, Fermentation, Distillation, Coagulation
  - The Archetypes (12): Zodiacal personas detached from gate ownership
- **Phase 3:** Built The Codex (64 cards, all 8 trigram families complete)
  - Family of Heaven (8), Earth (8), Thunder (8), Water (8), Mountain (8), Wind (8), Fire (8), Lake (8)
  - Each card named for actual I-Ching hexagram (e.g., Gate 15 = "Modesty", Gate 47 = "Oppression")
- **Status:** Build complete; integration/usage phase (Phase 4) pending
- **Planning document updated:** `System/PLAN - Oracle Deck Restructure.md` marked "Build Complete — Integration Pending"

**2026-01-31 (Late Night):** Oracle Deck restructure — The Window rebuilt from the ground up
- Identified core problem: current 64-card Window forces gates into interpretive categories rather than honoring what they are ("Stability" = Gate 20, but Gate 20 IS "Contemplation — The Now")
- **Principle reaffirmed:** "I use precise tools precisely" — the 64 gates/keys/hexagrams must exist as themselves
- Restructured from 64 cards to **88 cards** in two parts:
  - **The Athanor** (24 cards): The Materia (5: Prima Materia, Sulphur, Mercury, Salt, Philosopher's Stone) + The Furnace (7: classical alchemical operations) + The Archetypes (12: zodiacal personas, detached from gate ownership)
  - **The Codex** (64 cards): 8 trigram families × 8, each card named for the actual hexagram/gate/key
- Retired The Ten Portals (replaced by Furnace + Materia) and The Six Houses (replaced by 8 trigram families)
- 88 = 44 × 2 (angel deck tradition doubled) = 88 constellations (complete observable sky from the Observatory)
- Corrected 4 errors in Hexagrams.md trigram family table (hex 24, 33, 44, 54 were missing; 9, 16, 26, 45 were duplicated)
- **Decisions pending (wave processing):** deck name (candidates: Spectrum, Dial, Transmission, Constellation), Codex card naming convention, trigram family naming, Archetype gate resonances
- Planning document created: `System/PLAN - Oracle Deck Restructure.md`
- The Window name retired — no longer fits what this instrument is becoming
- Current 76 files of Window content to be archived when build begins; recognized as necessary 29-46 Channel of Discovery work, not waste

**2026-01-30 (Night):** Offerings page development — structure, content drafting, visual identity
- Brainstormed Offerings menu structure: established four service categories
- Named flagship multi-system offering **Archetypal Portrait** (charts + synthesis + Tarot/Oracle)
- Resolved pillar integration: Angelology and Magdalene Path are **practitioner-depth** systems (inform how you read, not what you present); Jungian/Personal Mythos is the interpretive language; four client-facing systems (Astrology, HD, Tarot, Window)
- Drafted and finalized **Astrology** page content (Jung quote, natal + transit services, written report emphasis)
- Drafted and finalized **Human Design** page content (Ra quote, Foundation/Cross/Relationship/Transit readings)
- Drafted and finalized **Tarot & Oracle** page content (Jung quote, Tarot/Oracle/Combined readings, Window Cards as proprietary companion system)
- **Visual identity cohesion:** Established site-wide image palette (dark teal base, amber/gold accents, cinematic depth). Re-generated HD and Astrology featured images to match. Generated Tarot & Oracle image (card + Elder Futhark runestones). All images now visually consistent.
- Generated blank bodygraph SVGs (with/without gate numbers) via humandesign_api renderer for image generation reference
- Drafted and finalized **Archetypal Portrait** page content (Anaïs Nin quote, three-movement structure: Architecture/Synthesis/Living Moment, two-session delivery model, prerequisite note for non-first-time clients, "Table of Contents for the story of You" closing)
- Featured image generated: open book with converging geometric systems rising from pages
- Drafted **Recommended Reading** page content (Mahler quote, five sections: Archetypal Psychology, Astrology, Human Design, Tarot, The Window — sources from Esoteric Grimoire only)
  - Excluded Rave I'Ching and Line Companion due to known dignity data errors
  - Added Archetypal Psychology section (Jung MDR, Campbell, von Franz)
  - Considering Chetan Parkyn's *Human Design* and *The Book of Lines* for future addition (pending acquisition and Grimoire inclusion)
  - Amazon affiliate links deferred until site has traffic
- **Full visual identity audit and cohesion pass:** Re-generated About (observatory), Ethics (scales), Human Design (bodygraph), and FAQ (compass) images to match established palette. All 8 featured images now share consistent teal/amber/illustrated style. Visual language documented in `~/Business/Website/STYLE-GUIDE.md`
- **All four Offerings pages + Recommended Reading complete and published to Ghost**

**2026-01-30 (Evening):** Practitioner's Ethics — from IHDS stance to ethics statement
- Explored mechanical basis for rejecting institutional certification while valuing education
- Discovered the **Four-Channel Learning Model** — all four defined channels (34-57, 6-59, 5-15, 29-46) form a complete learning sequence: Logic evaluates, Abstract commits to experience, Tribal seeks interpersonal transmission, Integration retains sovereign authority over application
- Identified that Tribal channel (6-59) has been underfed — Collective side (building, systematizing) heavily active, interpersonal learning hunger recognized
- Articulated the **Synthesis Principle**: learn each system's language independently (Hellenistic astrology, Jungian psychology), perform synthesis in the Observatory rather than inheriting someone else's
- Evaluated Library's astrological tradition: Traditional (Hellenistic/Medieval) foundations with Jungian-Psychological integration — "Archetypal Traditional" or "Psycho-Traditional"
- Researched potential astrology mentors: Brennan, Demetra George, Elenbaas, Liz Greene, Austin Coppock
- Evaluated Chris Brennan's course bundle (Hellenistic + Electional + Professional) — language, application, craft. No synthesis imposed. Live webinars provide Tribal dimension. Not a final decision — wave processing.
- Distinguished **objective certification** (competence) from **subjective certification** (allegiance) — reusable evaluation tool
- Document evolved from IHDS stance → learning model → practitioner's ethics statement
- Saved as `~/Personal/Biography/The Practitioner's Ethics — Mechanical Basis for a Rigorous Practice.md`
- **Drafted public Ethics page for Vibology website** — 11 ethical standards including clarity over comfort, rigor over vibes, no spiritual bypassing, transparency of method, client authority, lived experience as credential, no determinism, confidentiality and consent, scope of practice, non-discrimination. Published to Ghost.
- CLAUDE.md updated to V4.8 (added Practitioner's Design section §3)

**2026-01-30:** HD foundation assessment and IHDS decision
- Audited entire HD library (345 files) against Living Your Design curriculum
- Confirmed strong mechanical coverage (Types, Strategy, Authority, Centers, Gates, Channels, Profiles, Crosses, Variables all complete)
- Identified three concrete gaps: Definition Types, Projector Subcategories, Deconditioning detail
- Queried Grimoire — confirmed Ra's source texts cover Projector subtypes (Classic/Energy/Mental) and Generator subtypes (Pure/MG); Manifestors and Reflectors have no formal subcategories
- **Decision (processed through emotional wave):** Purchase LYD manual and complete IHDS foundation sequence (LYD, Rave ABCs, Rave Cartography) as source material — but decline further IHDS certification. The Observatory is not built inside someone else's institution.
- **Stance reminder:** Open Root wants to rush toward readiness. Open Heart says credentialing equals legitimacy. Both are Not-Self conditioning. Strategy and Authority override both. Still building. Still on the roof.

**2026-01-29 (Evening):** Chart workflow validation and protocol streamlining
- **Dignity data fixes:** Corrected three errors in exaltations_detriments.json
  - 26.2: North Node now exalted (was Sun)
  - 47.3: Sun now in detriment (was Mars)
  - 59.6: Mercury detriment now null/unknown (was Mercury)
- **Chart rendering improvements:**
  - Added city/nation to astrology.json meta output (fixes "Greenwich, GB" default)
  - Created `generate_chart_visuals.py` script for consistent SVG generation
  - Script handles both bodygraph and natal chart in single command
- **Protocol streamlining:** Removed redundancy between Client Work and Chart Data Acquisition
  - Added Protocol Scope sections clarifying workflow vs. technical boundaries
  - Eliminated duplicate file organization and birth data sections
  - Strengthened transit calculation mandate with ⚠️ MANDATORY flags
  - Reduced duplicate content by ~30 lines while maintaining clarity
- **Workflow validation:**
  - Tested complete new-client workflow with John Smith (birth data → full chart package)
  - Phrasing "New Client [Name], birth data [details]" successfully triggers full protocol
  - Generated Abbey Lewis Initial Client Report (6,200 words) following template
- **Result:** Chart generation workflow is production-ready; protocols are leaner and clearer

**2026-01-28 (Late Evening):** Observatory metaphor integration
- Integrated "The Observatory" as governing identity metaphor across three documents
- CLAUDE.md V4.7: Observatory framing in Core Identity, Intelligence Hierarchy, and Personas
- PROTOCOL - Client Work: Added Observatory Stance section (client as invited observer, not passive recipient)
- PROTOCOL - Cross-System Synthesis v1.1: Added Observatory Stance to Quality Standards (Third Meaning as observed, not manufactured)
- Origin: The glass house (false openness, Mars detriment at 59.3) destroyed by Saturn-Pluto conjunction 2020-01-12; what replaced it is the Observatory — built for seeing, not for protection
- Existing structures (Weaver, Scribe, Pillars, Refinement Cycle) unchanged — Observatory is the container that was always implied
- Pondering: Whether to change Vibology symbol from Seed of Life to observatory (sitting with emotional wave — no action yet)

**2026-02-03:** Oracle Deck — all Phase 0 decisions resolved
- **Deck name:** The Astrolabe (Greek *astrolabon*, "star-taker") — ancient observatory instrument; "a universe in your hand"
- **Card naming convention:** I-Ching hexagram name as primary, best English translation, 1-2 words. 13 names reworked from Wilhelm: Emergence (3), Accretion (9), Fellowship (13), Bounty (14), Remedy (18), Amassing (26), Overwhelm (28), Clinging Fire (30), Might (34), Wounded Light (36), Encountering (44), Marrying Maiden (54), Overstep (62)
- **Trigram family naming:** English image names (Heaven, Earth, Thunder, Water, Mountain, Wind, Fire, Lake); Chinese/symbol as correspondences
- **Archetype gate resonances:** Full detachment — Archetypes are zodiacal/Jungian figures only; all gate correspondences belong exclusively to the 64 Codex cards
- Phase 0 complete. Ready for Phase 1 (Archive & Restructure) when the wave settles.

**2026-01-28 (Evening):** Dignity data architecture decision
- Evaluated whether to include exaltation/detriment data in Library gate entries
- **Decision:** Do not add structured dignity tables to Library entries yet
  - API JSON (`exaltations_detriments.json`) remains computational source of truth
  - Errata document tracks corrections as discovered through real chart work
  - Library entries retain interpretive content without raw dignity tables
  - Revisit when errata stabilizes (after 20-30 more charts without new errors)
- Discussed systematic verification approach (Sun transit schedule for all 384 gate/lines)
  - Feasible but unnecessary given organic verification through client work
  - Each chart naturally verifies 13 gate/line combinations
- Key learning: Chart arrow notation now understood
  - Left/right arrows = Variables (Digestion, Environment, Perspective, Motivation)
  - Up/down arrows = Dignity indicators (exaltation ↑ / detriment ↓)

**2026-01-28 (PM):** Split-aspect gate indicators and dignity data integration
- Implemented split-aspect gate indicators via colored borders on gate circles:
  - Red/black split border: both design and personality aspects
  - Full red border: design-only activation
  - Full black border: personality-only activation
- Changed default bodygraph export format from PNG to SVG for scalability
- Added exaltation/detriment dignity data to `get_hd_data.py` script:
  - Each planet now includes `dignity` field ("exalted", "detriment", or null)
  - Supports synthesis protocol requirement for traceable claims
- Updated protocols:
  - Chart Data Acquisition: Added bodygraph SVG generation step
  - Client Work: Added bodygraph.svg to workflow and file organization
- Generated Szilvia Williams' bodygraph.svg with all new features
- All changes pushed to humandesign_api and VibologyOS repositories

**2026-01-28 (AM):** Human Design API bodygraph renderer improvements
- Replaced PNG triangle images with native SVG paths for exaltation/detriment symbols
- Fixed triangle vertical centering (separate viewBox dimensions for each triangle type)
- Implemented width compensation for equal border padding (exaltation vs detriment)
- Fixed critical API bug: `int(hours)` → `float(hours)` causing incorrect moon calculations
- Triangles now render at 8pt with proper positioning (10px from visible panel borders)
- Documented Gate 23.4 detriment discrepancy in EXALTATION_ERRATA.md

**2026-01-27:** Major repository cleanup and health assessment
- Comprehensive library audit (747 files, 99.9% cross-refs, 0 dead links)
- Deleted 33 temp scripts from root
- Archived 34 maintenance scripts from System/Scripts
- Archived completed plans and abandoned audits
- Updated CLAUDE.md to V4.4
- Relocated Consultations to ~/Business/
- Fresh NEXT.md (archived 64KB historical version)
