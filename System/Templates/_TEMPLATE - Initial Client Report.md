# Initial Client Report: {entity_id}

*An archetypal portrait synthesizing natal astrology, Human Design mechanics, and mythological resonance.*

---

## I. The Invitation

{Open with 2-3 paragraphs addressing the client directly. What brings them to this work? What does an "archetypal portrait" offer? Frame this as a map, not a verdict—a tool for self-understanding, not a fixed identity.

Acknowledge what can and cannot be known from birth data alone. The chart shows patterns and potentials; the client alone knows how these have manifested in lived experience.}

## II. Data Foundation

{This section presents the raw mechanics. Clinical, tabular, Scribe-voice. Interpretation comes later.}

## III. The Solar Story

{Weaver voice begins here. This section interprets the Sun placement as the core identity theme.}

### The Conscious Mission

{Synthesize the Sun sign, house, and aspects. What is this soul here to express? How does the Human Design Conscious Sun Gate speak to the same theme?

Draw from Library entries: [[{Sun Sign}]], [[Gate {X}]].

Look for convergence or tension between systems. Where they agree, confidence increases. Where they diverge, complexity emerges—hold both.}

### The Unconscious Foundation

{The Earth sign and HD Unconscious Sun represent what grounds and supports the mission. Often less visible to the individual but sensed by others.}

---

## IV. The Lunar Landscape

{The Moon and emotional centers reveal the inner life, needs, and vulnerability.}

### Emotional Architecture

{Moon sign, house, aspects. What does this soul need to feel safe? How do they process emotion?

Cross-reference with Solar Plexus definition (or openness) in Human Design. An open Solar Plexus with a Water Moon creates a very different experience than a defined Solar Plexus with a Fire Moon.

Draw from: [[{Moon Sign}]], [[Solar Plexus Center]].}

### The Not-Self Signature

{Based on HD Type, what does the Not-Self look like for this person? Frustration, bitterness, anger, disappointment? How might Moon patterns amplify or soothe this?}

---

## V. The Persona and Path

{Ascendant and HD Profile reveal how the person meets the world and learns through life.}

### The Rising Mask

{Ascendant sign and any planets conjunct. First impressions, survival strategy, the face shown to strangers.

Draw from: [[{Ascendant Sign}]].}

### The Profile Arc

{HD Profile (e.g., 3/5) as a life learning path. How do the two lines interact? What is the person's role in the collective story?

Draw from: [[Profile {X/Y}]].}

### Synthesis: Persona Integration

{Where Ascendant and Profile align or create productive tension. The Ascendant is the mask; the Profile is how the mask gets worn through time.}

---

## VI. The Incarnation Cross

{The HD Incarnation Cross as life purpose theme.}

### The Cross Configuration

{Name the cross and its four gates. What is the life theme this configuration encodes?

Draw from: [[{Incarnation Cross Name}]].}

### Astrological Parallels

{Do the nodal axis, Sun/Moon, or other astrological factors echo the Cross theme? The North Node often speaks to similar territory as the Incarnation Cross—evolution toward purpose.}

---

## VII. Archetypal Resonance

{Personal Mythos integration. Which archetypes, myths, or fairy tales illuminate this chart?}

### Primary Archetypes

{Based on the chart, which Jungian archetypes appear most activated?

Consider:
- Sun sign/house → Hero archetype variant
- Moon sign/house → Anima/Animus quality
- Saturn placement → Senex/Threshold Guardian
- Venus/Mars → Lover, Warrior, Shapeshifter
- Neptune/Pluto → Transformative archetypes

Draw from: [[The Hero]], [[The Shadow]], [[The Anima]], etc.}

### Mythological Parallels

{Which cultural myths or fairy tales resonate with this configuration?

A person with strong Pluto-Moon aspects might find resonance in [[Inanna's Descent]] or [[Persephone]]. Someone with a stellium in the 12th house might recognize themselves in tales of the [[Handless Maiden]] or monastery seekers.

Draw from World Mythology and Fairy Tales sections.}

### The Hero's Journey Placement

{Where might this person be in their own Hero's Journey? This is speculative without life context, but the chart can suggest:
- Saturn Return timing → Ordeal, Resurrection
- Nodal axis emphasis → Call to Adventure, Crossing Threshold
- Heavy 12th house → Ordinary World (unconscious), or Road Back (integration)

Draw from: [[The Hero's Journey]].}

---

## VIII. Shadow Cartography

{Every chart contains shadow material. Name it with compassion.}

### Planetary Shadow

{Squares, oppositions, planets in detriment or fall, retrograde signatures. Where are the growth edges?

Frame as: "This configuration suggests a potential struggle with..." not "You have a problem with..."}

### Not-Self Conditioning

{Open/undefined centers in HD. Where is this person vulnerable to taking in others' energy and mistaking it for their own?

Draw from relevant Center entries.}

### The Unlived Life

{What might be suppressed or undeveloped? Often found in the 12th house, South Node, or undefined HD centers. Not pathology—potential that awaits integration.}

---

## IX. Practical Wisdom

{Translate archetypal insight into lived guidance.}

### Strategy and Authority

{Reiterate the HD Strategy and Authority as the core decision-making tool. This is the most practical gift Human Design offers.}

### Timing Considerations

{Note any current or upcoming transits of significance:
- Saturn transits to natal planets
- Progressed Moon phase
- Eclipse contacts

This requires transit calculation—include only if requested or obviously relevant.}

### Integration Pathways

{Based on the synthesis, what practices might serve this person?
- Shadow work with specific archetypes
- Contemplation on specific myths or tales
- HD experiment recommendations
- Astrological remediation (if appropriate to your practice)}

---

## X. The Open Question

{End with what remains unknown. A good reading opens doors rather than closing them.}

{What would you want to know from the client to deepen this portrait? What can only be understood through conversation and lived experience?

Leave space for the client's own knowing to complete the picture.}
