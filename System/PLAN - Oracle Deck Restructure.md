# Oracle Deck Restructure Plan

*From The Window (64 cards) to The Astrolabe (88 cards)*

---

## Vision

The current 64-card Window system attempts to be two things simultaneously: the 64-fold architecture (I-Ching/Gates/Gene Keys) AND an interpretive overlay (Archetypes/Portals/Houses). This forces gates into categories rather than honoring what they are. The restructure separates these concerns into two distinct parts:

- **The Athanor** (24 cards) — The interpretive/archetypal/alchemical layer. Original Vibology synthesis.
- **The Codex** (64 cards) — The 64-fold architecture as it actually is. Each card named for what the gate/hexagram/key IS.

**Total: 88 cards** — mirroring the 88 constellations mapping the complete observable sky, and double the 44-card angel deck tradition.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Resolution | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Deck structure | 88 cards (24 + 64) | 2026-01-31 |
| Part names | The Athanor / The Codex | 2026-01-31 |
| Athanor sub-groups | The Materia (5), The Furnace (7), The Archetypes (12) | 2026-01-31 |
| The Materia cards | Prima Materia, Sulphur, Mercury, Salt, Philosopher's Stone | 2026-01-31 |
| The Furnace cards | 7 classical alchemical operations | 2026-01-31 |
| The Archetypes | 12 existing archetypes, detached from gate assignments | 2026-01-31 |
| Codex organization | 8 trigram families × 8 cards | 2026-01-31 |
| Current content | Archive (76 files); work was necessary step, not waste | 2026-01-31 |
| Rename deck | Yes — The Window no longer fits post-restructure | 2026-01-31 |
| Deck name | **The Astrolabe** — Greek *astrolabon*, "star-taker." Ancient instrument modeling the celestial sphere; "a universe in your hand." | 2026-02-03 |
| Codex card naming | I-Ching hexagram name (best English translation); HD/Gene Keys as correspondences. 1-2 words per name. 13 reworked from Wilhelm. | 2026-02-03 |
| Trigram family naming | English image names: Heaven, Earth, Thunder, Water, Mountain, Wind, Fire, Lake. Chinese/symbol as correspondences. | 2026-02-03 |
| Archetype gate resonances | Full detachment. Archetypes are zodiacal/Jungian only; all gate correspondences belong to the Codex. | 2026-02-03 |

---

## Open Decisions

### ~~1. Deck Name~~ — RESOLVED

**The Astrolabe** — Greek *astrolabon*, "star-taker." The definitive instrument of ancient observatories. A flat, portable model of the entire celestial sphere held in the hands and rotated to the observer's moment. 88 cards as a universe in your hand.

### ~~2. Codex Card Naming Convention~~ — RESOLVED

**I-Ching hexagram name as primary**, best available English translation (not locked to Wilhelm). HD gate keynote and Gene Key Shadow/Gift/Siddhi appear as correspondences on each card. Target: 1-2 words per card name.

Thirteen names reworked from Wilhelm for clarity, flow, or faithfulness to the Chinese:

| Hex | Wilhelm | Astrolabe Name | Rationale |
|-----|---------|---------------|-----------|
| 3 | Difficulty at the Beginning | **Emergence** | 屯 = pushing through; one word captures the struggle of arising |
| 9 | The Taming Power of the Small | **Accretion** | 小畜 = small accumulation; gradual, natural buildup |
| 13 | The Fellowship of Man | **Fellowship** | Simplified; removes dated gendered language |
| 14 | Possession in Great Measure | **Bounty** | 大有 = great having; fullness radiating outward |
| 18 | Work on What Has Been Spoilt | **Remedy** | 蠱 = decay/correction; names both the act and the solution |
| 26 | The Taming Power of the Great | **Amassing** | 大畜 = great accumulation; deliberate gathering of force |
| 28 | Preponderance of the Great | **Overwhelm** | 大過 = great exceeding; past the breaking point |
| 30 | The Clinging Fire | **Clinging Fire** | Wilhelm without article; 離 = clinging + fire/radiance |
| 34 | The Power of the Great | **Might** | 大壯 = great strength; inherent, undeniable power |
| 36 | Darkening of the Light | **Wounded Light** | 明夷 = brightness wounded/hidden |
| 44 | Coming to Meet | **Encountering** | Huang; 姤 = meeting/encountering |
| 54 | The Marrying Maiden | **Marrying Maiden** | Dropped article only |
| 62 | Preponderance of the Small | **Overstep** | 小過 = small exceeding; slight too-far |

All remaining 51 hexagram names retain Wilhelm's translation (already 1-2 words).

### ~~3. Trigram Family Naming~~ — RESOLVED

**English image names:** Family of Heaven, Family of Earth, Family of Thunder, Family of Water, Family of Mountain, Family of Wind, Family of Fire, Family of Lake. Chinese name (pinyin) and trigram symbol (☰ ☷ ☳ ☵ ☶ ☴ ☲ ☱) appear as correspondences within each card. Same principle as card naming — the image IS the identity; other systems annotate.

### ~~4. Archetype Gate Resonances~~ — RESOLVED

**Full detachment.** The 12 Archetypes carry no gate references — they are zodiacal and Jungian figures only. All gate/hexagram/Gene Key correspondences belong exclusively to the 64 Codex cards. Clean separation: the Athanor is the interpretive lens (archetypes, alchemy, elements), the Codex is the 64-fold architecture (gates, hexagrams, Gene Keys).

---

## The Athanor (24 Cards)

*The transformative lens — archetypal forces you look through before observing the 64-fold field.*

### The Materia (5 Cards) — WHAT is being transformed?

| # | Card | Principle | Oracle Function |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Prima Materia** | The undifferentiated beginning | What enters the work; raw potential; the unformed |
| 2 | **Sulphur** | Soul — consciousness, desire, combustion | The combustible principle; which soul-fire is active |
| 3 | **Mercury** | Spirit — connection, fluidity, mediation | The volatile principle; what mediates between above and below |
| 4 | **Salt** | Body — form, crystallization, fixity | The fixed principle; what crystallizes and endures |
| 5 | **The Philosopher's Stone** | The perfected result, integration | What emerges from the work; the completed transformation |

*Arc: Prima Materia (raw beginning) → Tria Prima (three active principles) → Philosopher's Stone (integrated result)*

### The Furnace (7 Cards) — HOW does transformation occur?

| # | Card | Operation | Oracle Function |
|---|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 6 | **Calcination** | Burning away the false | Destruction of ego attachments; purification by fire |
| 7 | **Dissolution** | Dissolving rigidity | Emotional release; letting structures melt |
| 8 | **Separation** | Discerning the genuine | Conscious filtering; choosing what to keep |
| 9 | **Conjunction** | Reuniting purified elements | Sacred marriage of opposites; integration |
| 10 | **Fermentation** | New life from decay | Inspiration; spiritual rebirth from breakdown |
| 11 | **Distillation** | Refining the essence | Purification of understanding; removing excess |
| 12 | **Coagulation** | Solidifying the new | Embodiment of transformation; the new form |

### The Archetypes (12 Cards) — WHO is present in the work?

| # | Card | Zodiac | 1980s Icon | Character |
|---|------|--------|------------|-----------|
| 13 | **The Hero** | Aries | Superman | Initiation; moral power; first responder |
| 14 | **The Great Mother** | Taurus | Sarah Connor | Fierce protection; nurturing through survival |
| 15 | **The Changeling** | Gemini | The Thing | Identity fluidity; terrifying adaptation |
| 16 | **The Divine Child** | Cancer | E.T. | Vulnerable innocence; miraculous healing |
| 17 | **The Persona** | Leo | Ziggy Stardust | Theatrical identity; the constructed mask |
| 18 | **The Wise Man** | Virgo | Mr. Miyagi | Self-mastery; discipline; spiritual mentorship |
| 19 | **The Muse** | Libra | Robert Smith | Soul-image; embodied aesthetic |
| 20 | **The Shape** | Scorpio | Michael Myers | Collective shadow; unassimilable boundary |
| 21 | **The Joker** | Sagittarius | The Joker | Chaos as catalyst; hunger for experience |
| 22 | **The Idol** | Capricorn | Madonna | Masculine spirit; pattern recognition leadership |
| 23 | **The Alchemist** | Aquarius | Prince | Individuated wholeness; breakthrough |
| 24 | **The Nightmare** | Pisces | Freddy Krueger | Gatekeeper testing readiness |

---

## The Codex (64 Cards)

*The observed field — the 64-fold architecture as it actually is, organized by trigram family.*

### Organization: 8 Families by Lower Trigram

The lower trigram represents the **inner/foundational energy** — what drives from beneath. Each family of 8 hexagrams shares this inner foundation while varying in outer expression (upper trigram).

| Family | Trigram | Image | Character |
|--------|---------|-------|-----------|
| ☰ Heaven (Qián) | ═══ | Sky | Creative force, initiative, strength |
| ☷ Earth (Kūn) | — — | Ground | Receptive field, devotion, yielding |
| ☳ Thunder (Zhèn) | ══— | Storm | Arousing, shock, movement |
| ☵ Water (Kǎn) | —═— | Deep | Abysmal, depth, danger |
| ☶ Mountain (Gèn) | —══ | Peak | Stillness, meditation, boundary |
| ☴ Wind (Xùn) | ═—— | Air | Gentle penetration, influence |
| ☲ Fire (Lí) | ═—═ | Flame | Clarity, illumination, attachment |
| ☱ Lake (Duì) | ——═ | Pool | Joy, expression, openness |

### The Eight Families — Complete Card Listing

> **Note:** Hexagram names follow I-Ching tradition, best available English translation (Wilhelm as default, with Huang/Karcher/others where Wilhelm is unwieldy). 13 names reworked for the Astrolabe — see resolved decision §2 above. Gene Keys show Shadow → Gift → Siddhi. Family assignments by lower trigram verified against I-Ching structure.

## Archival Plan

### Files to Archive (76 files)

Move to `.archive/Library/The Window/` preserving directory structure:

```
.archive/Library/The Window/
├── The Window.md (overview)
├── The Twelve Archetypes/ (12 files + CSV)
├── The Ten Portals/ (10 files)
├── The Six Lower Houses/ (6 overviews + 42 cards)
├── Hexagrams.md
├── Oracles.md
├── Shadow-Gift-Siddhi.md
└── Golden Path.md
```

### What Gets Preserved
- The 12 Archetype cards retain their core content (zodiac/icon/Jungian mapping) but are rebuilt without gate ownership
- The 1980s cultural encoding methodology
- The Gene Keys Shadow → Gift → Siddhi framework (applied now to actual gates)
- Cross-system integration approach

### What Gets Retired
- The Ten Portals (replaced by The Furnace + The Materia)
- The Six Houses structure (replaced by 8 trigram families)
- The 42 House Cards (gates now exist as themselves in The Codex)
- All gate-to-category assignments (Stability = Gate 20, etc.)

---

## Errata: Hexagrams.md Corrections

During planning, four errors were found in the existing `Hexagrams.md` trigram family table:

| Error | Family | Was | Should Be |
|-------|--------|-----|-----------|
| Hex 16 duplicated | Thunder → Earth | 16 in both Thunder and Earth | 16 in Earth only (lower ☷) |
| Hex 9 duplicated | Wind → Heaven | 9 in both Wind and Heaven | 9 in Heaven only (lower ☰) |
| Hex 26 duplicated | Mountain → Heaven | 26 in both Mountain and Heaven | 26 in Heaven only (lower ☰) |
| Hex 45 duplicated | Lake → Earth | 45 in both Lake and Earth | 45 in Earth only (lower ☷) |
| Hex 24 missing | Thunder | — | 24 belongs in Thunder (lower ☳) |
| Hex 33 missing | Mountain | — | 33 belongs in Mountain (lower ☶) |
| Hex 44 missing | Wind | — | 44 belongs in Wind (lower ☴) |
| Hex 54 missing | Lake | — | 54 belongs in Lake (lower ☱) |

These corrections are reflected in the family listings above.
