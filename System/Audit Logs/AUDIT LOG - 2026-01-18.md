# Library Audit Log: 2026-01-18

## Audit Summary

**Library Size:** 446 files across 7 pillars
**Audit Duration:** Full 10-phase review
**Status:** All phases complete, library ship-shape

---

## Findings by Phase

### Phase 1: Preparation
- **Library Size:** 446 files (excluding .archive and .obsidian)
- **Pillar Distribution:**
  - Angelology: 31 entries
  - Astrology: 37 entries
  - Personal Mythos/Folklore: 74 entries
  - Human Design: 140 entries
  - The Magdalene Path: 8 entries
  - The Tarot: 79 entries
  - The Window: 72 entries
  - Core Foundations: 5 entries

### Phase 2: Link Verification
**Issues Found:** 6 broken wikilinks
**Fixed:**
- `[[Angelology Overview]]` → `[[Angelology]]` (4 files in Nine Angelic Orders)
- `[[The Six Stages of Ascent|...]]` → `[[The Eight Boughs of Ascent|...]]` (2 files in Magdalene Path)

### Phase 3: Incomplete Entry Identification
**Issues Found:** 1 empty duplicate file
**Fixed:**
- Removed `/home/joe/VibologyOS/📖 Library/The Magdalene Path/The Magdalene Path.md` (0 bytes, duplicate of Overview)

**Noted (Acceptable):**
- Window card entries averaging 368-397 words (Tier 2 appropriate for card format)

### Phase 4: Outdated Content Review
**Issues Found:** 1 stale status file
**Fixed:**
- Updated `📖 Welcome to the Vibology Library.md`:
  - Fixed pillar links to use actual filenames
  - Updated status from "Structure ready for content" to accurate entry counts
  - Added total entry count and audit date

### Phase 5: Tag Consistency Check
**Status:** PASS
- All files have YAML frontmatter with tags
- All tags follow taxonomy (lowercase, hyphens)
- No uppercase or underscore violations found

### Phase 6: Orphaned Content Detection
**Status:** 56 files without direct incoming links
**Assessment:** Most are secondary entries (Profiles, Channels, Window emotional states) accessible via folder navigation. Not truly orphaned but could benefit from enhanced index linking in future.

**Recommendation:** Consider adding link lists to House Overview files and Human Design main entry for better discoverability.

### Phase 7: Index File Maintenance
**Status:** PASS
- All 7 pillar overview files exist with substantial content
- Old INDEX files properly archived
- `INDEX - Six Houses.md` remains in Window for house navigation

### Phase 8: File Structure & Naming
**Status:** PASS with note
- Consistent folder organization across all pillars
- No underscore violations in filenames

**Noted:** Same-named files exist in different folders:
- `The Anima.md` exists in both:
  - `Personal Mythos/Jungian Archetypes/` (Jungian concept, 933 lines)
  - `The Window/The Twelve Archetypes/` (Window archetype card, 106 lines)
- Not a conflict (different content, folder paths distinguish), but worth awareness

### Phase 9: Bloat/Repetition Check
**Status:** PASS
- Largest files (1000+ lines) are Tier 3 comprehensive entries
- Content is dense and substantive without filler
- Card entries appropriately concise
- Section headers (Cross-System, Internal Links, Keywords) are structural templates, not bloat

---

## Structural Notes

### Pillar Naming
The "Folklore" pillar (per CLAUDE.md) is stored as "Personal Mythos" in the Library folder. This is intentional—Folklore describes the system type while Personal Mythos describes the application.

### Tier Distribution
- **Tier 3 (Comprehensive):** Mythology entries, Archangel entries, Magdalene Path entries
- **Tier 2 (Developed):** Most card entries (Tarot, Window, Gates)
- **Tier 1 (Foundational):** Core Foundations entries

---

## Actions Taken

1. Fixed 6 broken wikilinks
2. Removed 1 empty duplicate file
3. Updated Welcome file with accurate status
4. Verified all tag taxonomy compliance
5. Confirmed content quality without bloat

---

## Next Audit

**Due:** ~April 18, 2026 (90-day cycle)

**Recommended Focus:**
- Consider adding link lists to House Overview files for better discoverability
- Monitor The Window for potential Tier 3 expansion when ready
- Continue maintaining cross-pillar link integrity as library grows
