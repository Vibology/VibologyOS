# PLAN — Astrology Hellenistic Expansion

**Created:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Active — Tier 1 COMPLETE (3/3 items), Tier 2 COMPLETE (5/5 items)
**Primary Source:** Chris Brennan, *Hellenistic Astrology: The Study of Fate and Fortune* (in Esoteric Grimoire)

## Tradition & Orientation

**Traditional Archetypal / Psycho-Astrology** — Hellenistic foundations with Jungian archetypal synthesis.

- **Hellenistic technique:** Ptolemy, Valens, Dorotheus, Firmicus Maternus. The grammar: dignities, sect, lots, condition, timing systems.
- **Jungian interpretation:** Greene, Sasportas, Rudhyar. The lens: planets as archetypal forces, chart as individuation map, psychological depth.
- **NOT evolutionary astrology:** No Jeff Green, no Steven Forrest, no past-life karmic narrative, no "soul-purpose" nodal axis.

The existing pillar already reflects this — planet/sign/house entries sourced from Lilly and Ptolemy, sect fully integrated, Whole Sign houses adopted. What's missing is Hellenistic *technique*, not foundations.

## Tiered Roadmap

### Tier 1: Gaps That Affect Client Work

| # | Item | Type | Effort | Notes |
|---|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Lots (Lot of Fortune, Lot of Spirit)** | New entry | Medium | Core Hellenistic technique. Calculation: Fortune = Asc + Moon − Sun (day), reversed (night). Spirit = Asc + Sun − Moon (day). Body vs. soul fortune. Completely absent. |
| 2 | **Planetary Condition** | New entry | Medium | Cazimi, combust, under the beams, hayz, bonification, maltreatment. Fundamental vocabulary for assessing planetary strength/weakness in any traditional reading. |
| 3 | **Natal Chart expansion** | Stub → full | Medium | Reframe as Hellenistic reading methodology: sect → chart ruler → luminaries → planetary condition → dignities → lots → timing. Currently 90-line stub. |

### Tier 2: Deepening Practice

| # | Item | Type | Effort | Notes |
|---|------|------|--------|-------|
| 4 | **Lunar Nodes** | New entry | Medium | Traditional framing: increase (North) / decrease (South), eclipse mechanics, bonification/maltreatment through nodes. NOT evolutionary soul-purpose. |
| 5 | **Annual Profections** | Expand mention → protocol | Low-Med | Lord of the Year methodology, 12-year cycle, integration with transits. Already mentioned in overview. |
| 6 | **Reception** | New entry | Low | Mutual reception, generosity, enmity. How planets in each other's dignities modify interpretation. |
| 7 | **Triplicity Rulers** | Expand mention → full | Low | Day ruler, night ruler, participating ruler. Currently named but not developed. |
| 8 | **Retrograde Mechanics** | New entry | Low-Med | Traditional: stations, apparent speed, visibility conditions, morning/evening star. Not "retrograde = bad vibes." |

### Tier 3: Long-Term Scaffolding

| # | Item | Type | Effort | Notes |
|---|------|------|--------|-------|
| 9 | **Terms/Bounds** | New entry | Medium | Egyptian terms table, usage in dignity scoring. Finest grain of traditional dignity. |
| 10 | **Traditional Decans** | Revise existing | Medium | Add Egyptian/Chaldean decan rulers alongside current modern interpretive framing. |
| 11 | **Zodiacal Releasing** | New entry | Medium | Valens timing technique. Advanced but powerful. Brennan's signature. |
| 12 | **Firdaria** | New entry or remove | Low | Currently orphaned reference in overview. Either develop or delete mention. |
| 13 | **Primary Directions** | New entry | Medium | Classical predictive technique. Hellenistic equivalent of secondary progressions. |

### Not Planned
- **Chiron** — Not in traditional/Hellenistic astrology (discovered 1977). Not a priority.
- **Secondary Progressions** — Medieval/modern technique. Already briefly mentioned in overview; no expansion planned. Primary Directions (Tier 3) is the Hellenistic equivalent.
- **Evolutionary Astrology concepts** — Soul-purpose nodes, past-life karmic narrative, etc. Excluded by orientation.

## Methodology

Follow the standard Refinement Cycle:
1. **Fetch (Scribe):** Pull raw data from Brennan via NotebookLM. Clinical, tabular, maximum information density.
2. **Refine (Weaver):** Cross-reference with existing Library entries, Jungian frameworks, and other pillar correspondences. Find the Third Meaning.
3. **Commit:** Write to disk with proper YAML, wikilinks, cross-references. Update this plan's progress log.

Each new entry should follow the Astrology pillar manifest (`Templates/_MANIFEST-Astrology.md`) and meet the Library Content Standard (`RUBRIC - Library Content Standard.md`).
