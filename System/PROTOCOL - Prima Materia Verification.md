# Prima Materia Verification Protocol

## Purpose

This protocol ensures that all content in the VibologyOS Library is **verifiable, traceable, and trustworthy**. Every factual claim must trace directly to source material in the **Esoteric Grimoire** (NotebookLM). This vault is intended to become the first access point for Vibology Synthesis work—there can be no doubt about its accuracy.

---

## Core Principle

**One Source, One Truth**

The **Esoteric Grimoire** (NotebookLM notebook: "Vibology: Seven Pillars Framework") is the sole authoritative source for prima materia. If content cannot be verified against this notebook, it must be:
1. Flagged as unverified
2. Marked as Vibology Synthesis (our original integration)
3. Removed if neither applies

---

## Source Hierarchy

### Primary Sources (Cite Directly)

These are texts **uploaded to the Esoteric Grimoire**. Cite them with full bibliographic detail:

| Source | In Grimoire | Citation Format |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Bourgeault, *The Meaning of Mary Magdalene* (2010) | ✓ | (Bourgeault, p. XX) or (Bourgeault, Ch. X) |
| de Quillan, *The Gospel of the Beloved Companion* (2010) | ✓ | (de Quillan, Ch. XX:XX) |
| Gospel of Mary (Berlin Codex) | ✓ | (Gospel of Mary) |
| Gospel of Philip (NHL II,3) | ✓ | (Gospel of Philip) |
| Gospel of Thomas (NHL II,2) | ✓ | (Gospel of Thomas, Logion XX) |
| *[Add other uploaded sources as identified]* | | |

### Secondary Sources (Cite as "X cites Y")

When a primary source *mentions* another author or work not in the Grimoire:

**Correct:**
> Bourgeault cites Charles Williams's theology of "mystical substitution" (Bourgeault, Ch. 12).

**Incorrect:**
> Williams, Charles. *Descent into Hell*. 1937. ❌

Secondary sources are only valid insofar as a primary source discusses them. We cannot verify claims against books not in the Grimoire.

### Vibology Synthesis (Mark Clearly)

Original integrations created by us—not direct prima materia—must be clearly marked:

```markdown
> *Vibology Synthesis: The following framework integrates [Source A] with [Source B].*
```

Examples of Vibology Synthesis content:
- Seven-Coordinate Navigation (Z-axis framework)
- Cross-pillar mappings (Magdalene stages ↔ Tarot keys)
- Original interpretive frameworks

Synthesis content should still be *anchored* to verified sources where possible.

## Verification Workflow

### Per-File Process

1. **Read the existing file** to understand its claims
2. **Query Esoteric Grimoire** for verification of key concepts
3. **Compare** file content against retrieved prima materia
4. **Add inline citations** linking statements to specific sources (MANDATORY - every claim)
5. **Mark Vibology Synthesis** sections with blockquote notation
6. **Create References section** with complete bibliographic data (MANDATORY - every file)
7. **Update YAML frontmatter** with verification metadata
8. **Run Verification Checklist** (see below) - all items must pass
9. **Commit** with meaningful message describing changes

### Post-Verification Checklist

Run this checklist on EVERY file before committing:

```bash
# Check for References section
grep -q "^## References" [filename] && echo "✓ Has References" || echo "✗ MISSING References section"

# Check for inline citations
grep -q "(Davidson\|Wang\|Agrippa\|Bourgeault\|Gospel of" [filename] && echo "✓ Has citations" || echo "✗ MISSING inline citations"

# Check for verification date in YAML
grep -q "^verified:" [filename] && echo "✓ Has verified date" || echo "✗ MISSING verified date"
```

**If any check fails, the file is INCOMPLETE and cannot be marked as verified.**

### YAML Frontmatter Updates

Add to each verified file:

```yaml
date_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
verified: YYYY-MM-DD
verification_source: Esoteric Grimoire
```

### Inline Citation Format

Use parenthetical citations for readability:

```markdown
The Fifth Way is the path of conscious love practiced in committed partnership (Bourgeault, 109).
```

For chapter references when page numbers unavailable:

```markdown
Substituted love involves the voluntary bearing of burdens (Bourgeault, Ch. 12).
```

For Gnostic texts:

```markdown
The nous exists "between" soul and spirit as the organ of perception (Gospel of Mary).
```

### References Section Format

Place at the end of each file, before the final `---`:

```markdown
## References

*All citations trace to sources in the Esoteric Grimoire (NotebookLM).*

Bourgeault, Cynthia. *The Meaning of Mary Magdalene: Discovering the Woman at the Heart of Christianity*. Boston: Shambhala, 2010.
- Fifth Way definition: p. 109
- Kenosis as "non-clinging": p. 114
- Bourgeault cites Boris Mouravieff on Fifth Way: pp. 109–114

de Quillan, Jehanne. *The Gospel of the Beloved Companion: The Complete Gospel of Mary Magdalene*. CreateSpace, 2010.
- Eight Boughs of Ascent: Ch. 42
```

---

## Quality Gates

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: NO FILE IS VERIFIED WITHOUT BOTH INLINE CITATIONS AND REFERENCES SECTION**

Before marking a file as verified, confirm:

- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Every factual claim has inline citation (Davidson, p. XX) or (Wang, Ch. X)
- [ ] **MANDATORY:** References section exists at end of file with full bibliographic details
- [ ] All cited sources are in the Esoteric Grimoire
- [ ] Secondary sources attributed as "X cites Y"
- [ ] Vibology Synthesis sections clearly marked with blockquote
- [ ] References section lists page numbers or chapter numbers for all citations
- [ ] YAML frontmatter includes `verified` date
- [ ] No orphaned claims (unsourced statements)

**Files lacking inline citations or References section are INCOMPLETE and must be remediated immediately.**

---

## Handling Unverified Content

### Content exists in file but NOT in Grimoire:

**Option A:** Mark as Vibology Synthesis if it's our original integration
**Option B:** Flag for later sourcing if the source exists but isn't uploaded
**Option C:** Remove if the content cannot be traced to any source

### Flagging for later sourcing:

```markdown
> *[Unverified: Source not in Esoteric Grimoire. Requires upload of [Book Title] to verify.]*
```

---

## Phased Execution Plan

Verification proceeds by pillar, smallest to largest:

| Phase | Pillar | Entries | Status |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|
| 1 | The Magdalene Path | 8 | ✅ **Complete** |
| 2 | Core Foundations | 5 | ✅ **Complete** |
| 3 | Angelology | 31 | 🔄 **In Progress** (5/31, 16%) |
| 4 | Astrology | 37 | Pending |
| 5 | Personal Mythos | 74 | Pending |
| 6 | The Tarot | 79 | Pending |
| 7 | The Window | 72 | Pending |
| 8 | Human Design | 337 | Pending |

**Total: 643 entries**
**Verified: 18 entries (3%)**

### Pace Control

- Maximum 10-15 entries per session (prevents fatigue, maintains rigor)
- One pillar at a time (no jumping between pillars mid-phase)
- Commit after each file or small batch
- Update this document after each milestone
