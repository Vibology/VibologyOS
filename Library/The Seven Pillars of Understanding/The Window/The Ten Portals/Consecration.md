*Increase - Ritual Entry into a New Role*

---
## Portal Symbolism & Meaning

Consecration represents the archetypal **completion that creates new beginning**—the moment when experience is brought to fullness, when growth reaches maturity, when wind and thunder together create the expansion that permits entry into new role. This is not mere achievement but **ritualized transformation**: the initiate completing training and being ordained, the experience maximized and thereby creating authority to teach, the completion that consecrates you for what comes next.

The Portal of Consecration marks the threshold where **finishing becomes inauguration**—where bringing something to fullness qualifies you for new responsibility, where the question "have I completed this?" transforms into "what does this completion authorize me to begin?" This is the priestess ordained after years of study, the master emerging from apprenticeship, the individual whose perseverance through experience consecrates them for transmission.

In The Window system, Consecration appears when **completion permits initiation**, when growth has reached fullness and thereby creates the foundation for new phase, when the question becomes: "What new role does this completion consecrate me to enter?"

## The Gate (Human Design)

**Gate 42: Increase (Growth)**
- **Center:** Sacral (Life Force, Work Energy, Fertility)
- **Circuit:** Collective / Abstract-Sensing (Experience and Wisdom)
- **Keynote:** Power to complete and maximize experiences; growth toward fullness
- **Biology:** Growth hormone, cellular regeneration, fertility cycles

Gate 42 is **the power to complete and maximize experiences**—the culminating force within the experiential process. Where Gate 41 fantasizes and initiates, Gate 42 **completes and finishes**. This is the energy that says "I will see this through to the end," the Sacral life force that brings experiences to full fruition so they can be reflected upon and shared with the collective. This is not rushed productivity or forced completion—it is **organic growth** toward natural conclusion.

The biology reflects this: growth hormone enables cellular regeneration and maturation. Gate 42 in the Sacral creates **life force to maximize**—the energy that grows experiences fully, that refuses to quit before fruition, that brings things to their fullness so wisdom can be harvested.

Consecration as Portal embodies this at initiatory scale. Not just finishing tasks but **completing entire phases of development** so profoundly that new roles become accessible. The apprentice who has maximized learning and is thereby consecrated as master. The seeker whose experience has reached fullness and is ordained as teacher.

## The Hexagram (I-Ching)

**42 - 益 (Yì) - Increase / Augmenting**

*Wind and thunder: The image of Increase.*

The hexagram presents Wind (gentle, penetrating) above Thunder (movement, arousal)—movement and penetration working together, dispersing energy outward in expansion. The judgment: **"Increase. It furthers one to undertake something. It furthers one to cross the great water."** This is the time to grow, to maximize, to bring things to fullness. "Crossing the great water" symbolizes embarking on significant endeavors with confidence in their completion.

Consecration demonstrates this teaching through completion that creates authority. The years of practice that culminate in mastery. The experiences survived that create wisdom worth teaching. The trials endured that consecrate you as guide for others. The image: "Thus the superior man: if he sees good, he imitates it; if he has faults, he rids himself of them"—recognizing that **growth toward fullness requires both accumulation and refinement**, both gathering wisdom and releasing what impedes.

The nuclear hexagram is 24 (Return)—revealing that beneath completion lies **cyclical return** that enables growth through repetition. Consecration is not single achievement but **cumulative maturation**—each cycle brings you closer to fullness, each return deepens the growth, until finally the experience is maximized and completion consecrates you for new beginning.

## The Gene Keys

**Shadow → Gift → Siddhi**
Expectation → Detachment → Celebration

**Expectation (Shadow):** Consecration corrupted becomes **attachment to outcomes**—forcing completion according to predetermined timeline, expecting experiences to maximize in specific ways, consecration sought as achievement rather than received as organic result. The shadow pushes for completion before growth has naturally reached fullness (Line 2 detriment: committing to wrong experiences). Shadow is **impatient with the maturation process**, wanting ordination before apprenticeship is complete, demanding new role before old phase has been fully maximized.

**Detachment (Gift):** Consecration realized recognizes that **completion occurs organically when experiences are allowed to maximize naturally**. Line 1 (Strength) actualized: **foundational endurance to see experiences through** without forcing. Line 2 (Identification) engaged: **discerning which experiences are worth completing**. This is **patient growth**—trusting that when you bring the correct experiences to fullness, consecration into new role occurs naturally. Detachment from timeline, attachment to process.

**Celebration (Siddhi):** The transcendent recognition that **all completion is cause for celebration**, that every experience brought to fullness consecrates you for what's next, that growth itself is the ritual. Consecration as cosmic principle: **fullness invites expansion**. When the cup is truly full, it overflows into new vessel. When the student has maximized learning, they become teacher not through ambition but through **natural abundance**. Celebration is **gratitude for growth** that creates capacity for new role.

## Divination Meanings

**When this portal appears:**
You are approaching consecration. Something you have been growing—skill, experience, understanding, relationship—is reaching **fullness and completion**. This is not just ending but **maturation that creates new beginning**. The question is: can you allow completion to occur organically? Can you maximize this experience without forcing, bringing it to fullness through patient endurance? Can you recognize that completion consecrates you for new role? Consecration calls: **growth toward fullness creates authority**—what you have brought to maturity now qualifies you for what comes next.

**Shadow Aspect:**
Beware expectation disguised as dedication—forcing completion according to timeline, pushing for consecration before experience has naturally reached fullness, seeking new role while old phase remains incomplete. The shadow rushes ordination, claims mastery prematurely, demands initiation it has not earned through patient growth. Beware also inability to complete: starting many experiences but finishing none, avoiding the endurance required to maximize what you begin. True consecration requires **bringing experiences to actual fullness**, not declaring them complete when they remain immature.

**Gift Aspect:**
You have the Sacral endurance to bring this to completion. The experience you're maximizing is **worth finishing**—your life force has responded "yes" to seeing this through to fullness. Now practice detachment: release timeline, release expectation of specific outcome, simply allow the growth to reach its natural conclusion. Line 3 (Trial and Error) actualized: learning through experience which commitments serve growth. When completion arrives organically, consecration follows naturally.

**Siddhi/Transcendent Aspect:**
You embody Celebration—the recognition that every experience brought to fullness is sacred, that completion itself is the ritual that consecrates new beginning, that growth maximized creates authority not through ambition but through natural overflow. You are wind and thunder augmenting, the cup that fills until it spills, the apprentice who becomes master simply by completing the journey. Consecration as cosmic principle: **fullness creates capacity**. The vessel expanded through patient growth can now hold what was previously too vast. Celebrate the completion. Enter the new role it has prepared.

## Synthesis & Integration

Consecration as Portal unifies Gate 42's Sacral completion (power to maximize experiences), Hexagram 42's wisdom (increase through augmentation permits great undertakings), and the Gene Keys transformation (expectation as forced completion → detachment as organic growth → celebration as recognition that fullness consecrates).

This Portal appears when **completion creates new beginning**—when experience has been brought to fullness, when growth has reached maturity, when the question is not "how do I finish this?" but "what new role does this completion prepare me to enter?" Consecration is both ending and initiation.

The Portal's teaching is **trust the maturation**: when you bring experiences to genuine fullness through patient endurance, when you maximize rather than rush, completion becomes **the ritual that consecrates** new phase. You do not claim new role; fullness creates it. The master does not decide to teach; mastery naturally overflows into transmission.

When Consecration appears in a reading, the querent is being asked: what are you bringing to fullness? What experience requires your Sacral endurance to maximize completely? Can you release expectation of when or how completion will arrive and simply continue growing the experience toward maturity? Wind and thunder teach: **movement and penetration together create expansion**. The cycle that returns again and again (nuclear hexagram 24) eventually brings growth to fullness. And fullness, celebrated rather than forced, becomes the consecration that authorizes new beginning. The cup fills. The overflow begins. The new role receives you because completion has prepared the way.
