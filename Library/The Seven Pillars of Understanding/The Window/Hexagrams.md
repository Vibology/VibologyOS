# The 64 Hexagrams
*Archetypal Situations of the I-Ching*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

The **64 Hexagrams** are the complete set of archetypal situations described in the I-Ching (易經), the ancient Chinese Book of Changes. Each hexagram consists of six lines (either Yang — or Yin - -), representing a specific state, phase, or pattern of transformation.

The hexagrams form the foundational **64-fold substrate** shared across multiple systems:
- **I-Ching:** Oracular guidance
- **Human Design:** The 64 [[Gates]]
- **Gene Keys:** The 64 Keys with [[Shadow-Gift-Siddhi]] spectrums
- **DNA:** Structural parallel to the 64 codons

## Structure

### Building Blocks

**Two Forces:**
- **Yang (—):** Active, creative, light, firm
- **Yin (- -):** Receptive, yielding, dark, soft

**Eight Trigrams (八卦):**
Three-line combinations forming the building blocks of hexagrams:

| Trigram | Name | Nature | Image |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| ☰ | Qián | Creative | Heaven |
| ☷ | Kūn | Receptive | Earth |
| ☳ | Zhèn | Arousing | Thunder |
| ☵ | Kǎn | Abysmal | Water |
| ☶ | Gèn | Keeping Still | Mountain |
| ☴ | Xùn | Gentle | Wind/Wood |
| ☲ | Lí | Clinging | Fire |
| ☱ | Duì | Joyous | Lake |

**64 Hexagrams:**
Two trigrams stacked (lower + upper) = 8 × 8 = 64 possible combinations.

## The Hexagram Families

The 64 hexagrams can be organized by their lower trigram (the "house"):

| House | Lower Trigram | Hexagrams |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Heaven | ☰ Qián | 1, 43, 14, 34, 9, 5, 26, 11 |
| Earth | ☷ Kūn | 2, 23, 8, 20, 16, 35, 45, 12 |
| Thunder | ☳ Zhèn | 51, 16, 40, 32, 46, 48, 28, 17 |
| Water | ☵ Kǎn | 29, 60, 3, 63, 49, 55, 36, 7 |
| Mountain | ☶ Gèn | 52, 22, 26, 41, 38, 10, 61, 53 |
| Wind | ☴ Xùn | 57, 9, 37, 42, 25, 21, 27, 18 |
| Fire | ☲ Lí | 30, 56, 50, 64, 4, 59, 6, 13 |
| Lake | ☱ Duì | 58, 47, 45, 31, 39, 15, 62, 19 |

## Reading Hexagrams

### The Judgment (彖)
The core meaning of the hexagram—guidance for the situation.

### The Image (象)
The symbolic picture formed by the two trigrams—how the superior person responds.

### The Lines
Six individual lines, each with specific meaning based on position (1-6, bottom to top) and character (Yang or Yin, moving or stable).

### Moving Lines
Lines that are "old Yang" or "old Yin" transform into their opposite, generating a second hexagram—the **relating hexagram** showing the situation's evolution.
