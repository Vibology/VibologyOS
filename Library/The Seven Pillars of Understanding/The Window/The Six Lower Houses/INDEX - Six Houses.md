# INDEX - The Six Houses of The Window

**Domain Organization:** Parallel experiential realms (not hierarchical)

**Completion Status:** ✅ All 6 Houses complete (Tier: House Foundation)

---

## Overview

The Six Houses represent **parallel domains of human experience** where the 42 House cards manifest. Unlike the Twelve Archetypes (WHO you are) and Ten Portals (HOW you transform), the Houses map **WHERE/WHAT—the experiential realms** in which life unfolds.

**Critical Understanding:**
- NO hierarchy between Houses—all are parallel domains
- Each House governs 7 gates from Human Design
- Three Houses correspond to classical elements (Land/Earth, Sea/Water, Flame/Fire)
- Three Houses transcend elements (Chronicle/Narrative, Spirit/Consciousness, Stars/Mastery)

## Using the Houses in Divination

**House concentration (3+ cards from same House):**
- Indicates the querent's current life domain focus
- Reveals where energy/attention is concentrated
- Shows which realm demands integration

**House absence (no cards from a House):**
- May indicate neglected domain
- Could suggest domain is not relevant to current question
- Beware over-focus on one domain at expense of others

**Shadow vs. Gift positions:**
- Same House in shadow = domain corrupted (e.g., Land shadow = insecurity, fragility)
- Same House in gift = domain mastered (e.g., Land gift = stability, integrity)
- Mixed positions = integration in progress

**House pairings reveal integration needs:**
- Land + Sea = Embodying emotion
- Flame + Spirit = Aligning will with consciousness
- Chronicle + Stars = Narrative shaping achievement
- Sea + Flame = Emotion meeting action (risk: rage)
- Spirit + Land = Incarnating awareness
- Chronicle + Sea = Story honoring feeling
