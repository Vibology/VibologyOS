# Heart Chakra Meditation
*Anahata Practice — Opening the Heart Center*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Heart Chakra Meditation** is a contemplative practice focused on opening and balancing **Anahata** (अनाहत, "unstruck sound"), the fourth chakra, located at the center of the chest. The heart chakra governs:

- **Love** (universal compassion, not just romantic love)
- **Compassion** (capacity to feel with others without being overwhelmed)
- **Forgiveness** (releasing resentment, healing wounds)
- **Connection** (bridge between self and other, lower and upper chakras)

Practice involves:
1. Seated meditation, focus on the heart center
2. Visualization of green or pink light, expanding with each breath
3. Affirmations or mantras (e.g., *"I am open to love," "YAM"*)
4. Sending loving-kindness (metta) to self, loved ones, all beings

Regular practice cultivates emotional resilience, empathy, and the capacity to give from overflow rather than depletion.
