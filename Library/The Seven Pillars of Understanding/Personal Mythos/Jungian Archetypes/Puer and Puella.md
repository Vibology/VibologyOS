## Overview

**Puer aeternus** (masculine) and **Puella aeterna** (feminine)—Latin for "eternal boy" and "eternal girl"—are Jungian archetypes representing the **spirit of eternal youth**: spontaneity, creativity, play, freedom, and the refusal to accept limitation or aging. The Puer/Puella embodies the **divine youth** who lives in perpetual potentiality, resisting the descent into structure, commitment, and time-bound existence.

James Hillman's *Puer Papers* (building on Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz) describes the Puer as the archetype of **flight, ascent, and spiritual aspiration**—the one who seeks the heights but fears the earth, who dreams but resists manifestation.

### Key Characteristics

- **Eternal Potentiality:** Lives in "what could be" rather than "what is"
- **Spontaneity and Play:** Refuses routine, structure, obligation
- **Spiritual Aspiration:** Seeks transcendence, peak experiences, the ideal
- **Refusal of Limitation:** Resists commitment, aging, responsibility
- **Opposes Senex:** The Puer-Senex polarity represents youth vs. age, freedom vs. structure

- Addiction to peak experiences; inability to sustain relationships
- Narcissistic inflation (identifying with the divine rather than embodying it)
- Flight from commitment, responsibility, embodiment

## Relationship to Other Archetypes
