# Imago Dei
*The God-Image in the Human Psyche*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Imago Dei** (Latin: "image of God") is Jung's term for the God-image—the archetypal representation of the divine as it appears within the human psyche. It is not God itself but the **psychological experience of the numinous**—the way the infinite manifests in finite consciousness.

> "The God-image in man was not invented, it was experienced. It is an autonomous psychic content, and numinous—i.e., it is capable of overpowering the conscious mind." (Jung, CW 11)

The Imago Dei is empirically indistinguishable from the archetype of [[The Self]]—both represent wholeness, totality, and the transcendent function that unites opposites.

## Key Concepts

### The God-Image as Archetype
The Imago Dei is not a theological claim about God's existence but a **psychological fact**—humans universally produce images of the divine. These images are autonomous, numinous, and capable of transforming consciousness.

### Projection and Withdrawal
Historically, the God-image was projected onto:
- Nature (animism)
- Deities (polytheism, monotheism)
- Institutions (Church, State)
- Individuals (saints, gurus, leaders)

Modern psychology witnesses the **withdrawal of projections**—the recognition that the God-image is an inner reality, not merely an outer object.

### The Self as God-Image
Jung identified the Self (the archetype of wholeness) with the Imago Dei:
- Both represent totality
- Both unite opposites (light/dark, masculine/feminine)
- Both are experienced as numinous and autonomous
- Both serve as the goal of [[Individuation Process|individuation]]

## The Problem of Evil

Jung's controversial contribution: the God-image includes **both light and shadow**. In *Answer to Job*, Jung argues that the biblical God contains contradictions—both mercy and wrath, creation and destruction. The Imago Dei must be integrated, not merely worshipped.
