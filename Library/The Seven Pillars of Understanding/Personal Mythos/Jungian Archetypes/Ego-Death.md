# Ego-Death
*The Dissolution of Identity — Mystical Annihilation and Rebirth*

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Ego-Death** is the psychological and spiritual experience of the **dissolution of the sense of separate self**—the temporary or permanent collapse of ego-boundaries, leading to mystical union, terror, or both.

Ego-death occurs in:
- Mystical experiences (union with the divine)
- Psychedelic states (dissolution of subject/object duality)
- Severe trauma or crisis (breakdown of identity structures)
- Advanced meditation practices (cessation, nirvana)
- Crossing [[The Abyss]] in esoteric initiation

Ego-death can be **terrifying** (loss of control, annihilation anxiety) or **liberating** (union, oceanic bliss). Integration is essential—returning to functional ego-consciousness without inflation or fragmentation.
