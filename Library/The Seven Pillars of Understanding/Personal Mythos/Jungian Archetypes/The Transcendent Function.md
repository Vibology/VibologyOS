# The Transcendent Function
*The Union of Opposites — Psychic Synthesis Through Creative Tension*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

The **Transcendent Function** is Jung's term for the psyche's capacity to hold **opposites in tension** until a **third thing** emerges that reconciles and transcends both. It is the psychological mechanism of **creative synthesis**, allowing consciousness to move beyond either/or thinking into both/and integration.

Example: Thesis (freedom) + Antithesis (responsibility) → Synthesis (mature autonomy that honors both)

The transcendent function operates through dreams, active imagination, art, and symbolic work. It is central to the process of Individuation—the integration of unconscious contents into conscious awareness.
