## Overview

**The Inner Child** is a psychological concept (more clinical than archetypal) referring to the **internalized child-self**—the part of the psyche that retains childhood experiences, wounds, needs, and authentic spontaneity. Unlike [[The Divine Child]] (which is an archetypal pattern in the collective unconscious), the Inner Child is **personal**: your specific childhood self, with its unique joys, traumas, and emotional truths.

The Inner Child work became prominent in recovery movements, trauma therapy, and Jungian-influenced psychology through figures like John Bradshaw, Alice Miller, and Robert Bly. It focuses on:
- **Reparenting wounded aspects** of the self
- **Reconnecting with authentic emotion** and spontaneity
- **Healing developmental trauma** through inner dialogue and compassionate witness

### Key Aspects

**The Wounded Child:**
- Carries unmet childhood needs (safety, love, validation)
- Holds traumatic memories and emotional pain
- Manifests as triggers, emotional reactivity, compulsive patterns
- Requires compassionate witness and reparenting

**The Playful Child:**
- Source of spontaneity, joy, creativity, wonder
- Unself-conscious presence and authentic expression
- Connection to sensory delight and playful exploration
- Often repressed in service of adult productivity

## Distinction from Related Concepts

- **[[The Divine Child]]:** Archetypal/mythological pattern; universal symbol of futurity and rebirth
- **[[Puer and Puella]]:** Archetypal eternal youth; more about refusing maturity than healing wounds
