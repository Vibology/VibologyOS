> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**The Senex** (Latin: "old man") is the Jungian archetype of the **Wise Elder**—the figure of earned authority, discipline, structure, and the wisdom that comes through limitation and time. The Senex is intimately connected to **Saturn** in astrological symbolism and represents the **mature masculine principle** that has integrated experience into wisdom.

### Key Characteristics

- **Earned Authority:** Power through mastery and endurance rather than raw force
- **Discipline and Structure:** The container that allows creativity to manifest
- **Limitation as Wisdom:** Understanding boundaries as teachers rather than obstacles
- **Time-Consciousness:** Awareness of mortality, legacy, and consequence
- **Opposes Puer/Puella:** The Senex-Puer polarity represents maturity vs. eternal youth

## Astrological Correspondence

- **Planet:** [[Saturn ♄]]
- **House:** [[10th House]] (public authority, mastery, vocation)
- **Sign:** [[Capricorn ♑]] (discipline, structure, earned achievement)
