## Overview

**Synchronicity** is Jung's term for **meaningful coincidences**—events that are connected not by cause-and-effect but by **shared meaning**. Synchronicities occur when an inner psychological state (thought, dream, emotion) corresponds to an outer event with no causal link between them.

Examples:
- Thinking of a friend moments before they call
- Dreaming of a symbol that appears the next day
- Encountering the exact book/person/information needed at a critical moment

Jung proposed synchronicity as evidence of the **psychoid** nature of reality—that psyche and matter share a common ground in the **unus mundus** (one world). Synchronicities increase during times of heightened emotional intensity, crisis, or [[Individuation]].
