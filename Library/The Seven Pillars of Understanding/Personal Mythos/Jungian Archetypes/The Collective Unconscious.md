> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

The **Collective Unconscious** is Carl Jung's term for the **deepest layer of the psyche**, shared by all humans across cultures and time. Unlike the **personal unconscious** (individual repressed memories and complexes), the collective unconscious contains **archetypal patterns**—universal images, symbols, and motifs that appear in myths, dreams, religions, and art worldwide.

Jung wrote: *"The collective unconscious contains the whole spiritual heritage of mankind's evolution, born anew in the brain structure of every individual."*

Key archetypes residing in the collective unconscious include [[The Shadow]], [[The Anima]], [[The Animus]], [[The Self]], [[The Great Mother]], [[The Wise Old Man]], and others.
