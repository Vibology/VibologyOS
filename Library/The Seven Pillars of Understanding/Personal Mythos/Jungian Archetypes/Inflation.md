## Overview

**Inflation** (or **psychic inflation**) is a Jungian term for the condition where the **ego identifies with archetypal forces** from the unconscious, leading to grandiosity, hubris, and loss of groundedness.

When the ego inflates, it believes itself to be more than it is—a god, a messiah, a genius—rather than recognizing it is being **moved by** archetypal energies. Common causes include:
- Contact with numinous experiences without integration
- Identification with [[The Hero]], [[The Wise Old Man]], or [[The Great Mother]]
- Spiritual bypass (claiming enlightenment prematurely)

The remedy is **humility**, recognition of the Self as greater than the ego, and grounding in ordinary human reality.
