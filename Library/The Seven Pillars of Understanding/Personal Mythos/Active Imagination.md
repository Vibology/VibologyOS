# Active Imagination
*Dialogue Between Conscious and Unconscious*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

**Active Imagination** is Carl Jung's primary technique for conscious engagement with unconscious contents. Unlike passive dreaming or free association, active imagination is a **deliberate, waking dialogue** between the ego and autonomous figures of the psyche—a bridge for integrating unconscious material into consciousness.

> "The art of letting things happen, action through non-action, letting go of oneself... became for me the key opening the door to the way. We must be able to let things happen in the psyche." (CW 13, par. 20)

Active imagination is the practical methodology of [[Individuation Process|individuation]]—the means by which one actually engages the [[The Shadow|Shadow]], [[The Anima|Anima]], [[The Animus|Animus]], and ultimately the [[The Self|Self]].

## The Method

### 1. Preparation
- Enter a state of relaxed attention (neither trance nor ordinary consciousness)
- Suspend judgment and rational critique
- Adopt an attitude of openness to whatever emerges

### 2. Invocation
- Begin with a dream image, fantasy, mood, or bodily sensation
- Allow the image to develop autonomously
- Resist the temptation to direct or control

### 3. Dialogue
- Engage the figure or image as a real interlocutor
- Ask questions; listen to responses
- Allow the figure its own voice, distinct from ego

### 4. Integration
- Record the experience (writing, drawing, painting, sculpture)
- Reflect on meaning without reducing to interpretation
- Translate insight into ethical action

## Distinctions

**Active Imagination vs. Fantasy:**
Fantasy is passive and ego-directed; active imagination is dialogical and allows autonomous response from the unconscious.

**Active Imagination vs. Meditation:**
Meditation typically seeks to quiet mental content; active imagination deliberately engages it.

**Active Imagination vs. Pathworking:**
[[Pathworking]] uses pre-established symbolic frameworks (Tarot, Qabalah); active imagination follows the psyche's own spontaneous imagery.

## Cautions

Jung warned that active imagination requires:
- A stable ego (not suitable for acute psychosis or fragile ego states)
- Ethical responsibility (insights must be embodied, not merely collected)
- Discrimination (not all unconscious contents are wise or benevolent)

The goal is **dialogue**, not possession—the ego must neither repress nor be overwhelmed by unconscious contents.
