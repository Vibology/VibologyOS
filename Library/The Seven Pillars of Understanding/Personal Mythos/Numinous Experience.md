## Overview

**Numinous Experience** is theologian Rudolf Otto's term (from Latin *numen*, "divine presence") for the direct encounter with the **holy**—the **mysterium tremendum et fascinans**, the mystery that is both terrifying and fascinating.

Otto identified three characteristics of the numinous:
1. **Tremendum** — Awe, terror, the overwhelming
2. **Majestas** — Majesty, power, absolute otherness
3. **Fascinans** — Attraction, beauty, irresistible draw

Jung adopted the concept to describe encounters with archetypal forces from [[The Collective Unconscious]]. Numinous experiences may occur through religious ritual, spontaneous visions, dreams, nature encounters, or psychedelic states.
