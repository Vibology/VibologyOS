# Inanna
*Queen of Heaven and Earth — Goddess of Love and War*

## Overview

**Inanna** (Sumerian) or **Ishtar** (Akkadian/Babylonian) is the Mesopotamian goddess who unites **love and war** in one divine being—the most powerful expression of the feminine as both nurturer and destroyer. She is the Queen of Heaven, the Morning and Evening Star (Venus), and the goddess whose myths encode death, descent, and resurrection.

Inanna represents the **paradox of the fierce feminine**—simultaneously the goddess of sensual pleasure and violent conquest, of fertility and destruction, of life-giving love and death-dealing wrath.

## Key Myths

**The Descent of Inanna:**
The most famous myth: Inanna descends to the underworld to visit her sister Ereshkigal (Queen of the Dead). At each of the seven gates, she must remove one piece of her regalia—arriving naked and powerless. Ereshkigal kills her and hangs her corpse on a hook. Only through the intervention of Enki (god of wisdom) is she resurrected—but she must provide a substitute. She chooses her consort Dumuzi, who was not mourning her death.

This myth encodes:
- **The necessary descent into shadow** for transformation
- **Stripping of persona** (each gate removes identity)
- **Death before rebirth**
- **The substitute sacrifice** (someone must remain in the underworld)

**Inanna and Dumuzi:**
Inanna's sacred marriage to Dumuzi (shepherd-king) was ritually enacted in Mesopotamian kingship ceremonies—the king embodying Dumuzi, the priestess embodying Inanna. Their union ensured fertility of land and people.

**Inanna's Conquest:**
Unlike passive love goddesses, Inanna is a **warrior queen**. She leads armies, crushes enemies, and claims political power. The *Hymn to Inanna* describes her as "clothed in terror," raining fire on lands that displease her.

## Astrological Correspondence

- **Planet:** [[Venus ♀]] (Morning/Evening Star)
- **Domain:** Love, desire, sexuality, beauty, political power, warfare
- **Greek/Roman Equivalent:** [[Aphrodite]]/Venus (but with Inanna's warrior aspect often split off into separate goddesses)

## Archetypal Significance

**Love and War United:**
Inanna uniquely holds **both Venus and Mars energies**—she is desire AND aggression, beauty AND power. She refuses the split between "good feminine" (nurturing) and "bad feminine" (destructive).

**The Descent as Initiation:**
Inanna's underworld journey is the archetypal **katabasis**—the descent into the unconscious, the confrontation with death, the necessary dismemberment before reintegration. This is the shamanic death-rebirth, the Dark Night of the Soul.

**Sacred Sexuality:**
Inanna's temples practiced **sacred prostitution** (disputed by some scholars)—sexuality as divine worship, pleasure as sacred act, the body as temple.

**The Substitute Sacrifice:**
Dumuzi's role as substitute reveals a shadow truth: **transformation requires sacrifice**. Someone or something must be left behind. Inanna cannot return unchanged and reclaim her old life intact.
