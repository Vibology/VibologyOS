# Prometheus
*The Forethought — Titan Who Stole Fire for Humanity*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Prometheus** (Προμηθεύς, "Forethought") is the Titan who **stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity**—an act of divine rebellion that brought civilization, technology, and consciousness to mortals at the cost of eternal punishment.

Prometheus is not an Olympian but a Titan—one of the older generation of gods who sided with Zeus during the Titanomachy yet later defied him to serve humanity. He represents the **principle of progress through transgression**, the benefactor who violates divine law to liberate consciousness.

## Key Myths

**The Theft of Fire:**
Zeus had withheld fire from humanity (after they received sacrificial meat through Prometheus's trickery). Prometheus stole fire from Olympus and delivered it to mortals—granting them technology, cooking, metalwork, and the light of consciousness itself.

**Prometheus Bound:**
As punishment, Zeus chained Prometheus to a rock in the Caucasus Mountains where an eagle ate his liver daily—only for it to regenerate each night, creating eternal suffering. The liver (seat of emotion and vitality) is consumed and reborn endlessly.

**Release by Heracles:**
After ages of torment, Heracles (with Zeus's eventual consent) shot the eagle and freed Prometheus—encoding the principle that the rebel and the authority must eventually reconcile.

**Creation of Humanity:**
In some versions, Prometheus shaped humanity from clay and Athena breathed life into them—making him not just benefactor but **creator** of the human race.

## Archetypal Significance

**The Divine Rebel:**
Prometheus embodies **rebellion in service of evolution**—the one who breaks the law to serve a higher good. He violates divine authority to liberate humanity from ignorance and dependence.

**Fire as Consciousness:**
The stolen fire is not merely physical flame but **consciousness itself**—the spark of self-awareness, the capacity to think, create, and question. Prometheus is the bringer of enlightenment.

**Suffering for Others:**
Prometheus's eternal punishment encodes the archetype of **the martyr, the suffering savior**—the one who bears pain so others may thrive. His liver (regeneration) suggests that suffering born for consciousness is renewable, meaningful.

**Foresight (Prometheus) vs. Hindsight (Epimetheus):**
Prometheus ("forethought") is paired with his brother Epimetheus ("afterthought")—the polarity of planning vs. reaction, wisdom vs. impulsivity. Humanity needs both but thrives when foresight leads.
