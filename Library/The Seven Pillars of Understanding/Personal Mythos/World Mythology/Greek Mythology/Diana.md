## Overview

**Diana** is the Roman goddess of the hunt, wilderness, and the moon—closely identified with Greek [[Artemis]] but with distinct Roman characteristics. As **Diana Trivia** ("Diana of the Three Ways"), she presides over crossroads and is associated with the underworld. As **Diana Nemorensis** ("Diana of the Wood"), she was worshipped at the sacred grove of Nemi.

Diana embodies the **triple lunar goddess**: maiden (new moon), mother (full moon), and crone (dark moon)—though Roman tradition emphasized her virginal, autonomous aspect.

## Key Aspects

**Diana Nemorensis:**
The "Queen of the Grove" worshipped at Lake Nemi, where her high priest (the *Rex Nemorensis*) could only attain office by slaying his predecessor in single combat. This brutal succession encoded the principle that **sovereignty must be continually earned through strength**.

**Diana Trivia:**
As goddess of crossroads (*trivia* = three ways), Diana governs thresholds and liminal spaces. She is invoked at moments of decision, transition, and the crossing between known and unknown.

**Diana and Hecate:**
In later Roman tradition, Diana was conflated with Hecate (Greek underworld goddess), forming a triple identity: Diana in heaven, Diana on earth, and Hecate in the underworld.
