# Hermes
*Messenger of the Gods — Trickster and Guide Between Worlds*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Hermes** (Ἑρμῆς, Roman: **Mercury**) is the Olympian god of **boundaries, communication, and transitions**. He is the divine messenger who carries words between gods and mortals, the guide who escorts souls to the underworld, the trickster who operates at thresholds, and the patron of merchants, thieves, and travelers.

Hermes is the **psychopomp** (soul-guide), the one who moves freely between realms—Olympus, Earth, and Hades. He is liminal, quicksilver, impossible to pin down. Jung associated Hermes with the **mercurial spirit** in alchemy: the agent of transformation that cannot be grasped.

## Key Myths

**The Cattle Theft:**
On the day of his birth, infant Hermes stole Apollo's sacred cattle and invented the lyre from a tortoise shell. When Apollo discovered the theft, Hermes charmed him with music—establishing the principle that **cleverness and art can transform transgression into gift**.

**Hermes as Psychopomp:**
Hermes guides souls to the underworld, crossing the boundary between life and death. He is not death itself (that is Thanatos) but the **mediator**: the one who knows the way between worlds.

**Hermes and Hades:**
Hermes is one of the few gods who can enter and exit Hades freely. He retrieved Persephone from the underworld (at Zeus's command) and guided heroes like Odysseus and Heracles through the shadowy realm.

## Archetypal Significance

**The Trickster:**
Hermes embodies [[The Joker|The Trickster]] archetype—the boundary-crosser who operates at thresholds, who violates norms to reveal truth, who is simultaneously helper and hindrance. He is the divine con artist, the sacred thief.

**The Messenger:**
Hermes is the **voice that carries meaning**—language, symbol, interpretation. He is the hermeneutic principle itself (hermeneutics derives from his name): the art of translation, interpretation, and understanding across difference.

**The Psychopomp:**
As guide between realms, Hermes represents the **mediator between conscious and unconscious**. He descends into the underworld (the psyche's depths) and returns with messages from below.
