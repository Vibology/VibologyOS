# Aphrodite
*Goddess of Love — Beauty, Desire, and the Principle of Attraction*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Aphrodite** (Ἀφροδίτη, Roman: **Venus**) is the Olympian goddess of **love, beauty, desire, and sexual pleasure**. Born from sea foam (*aphros*) that formed around the severed genitals of Uranus, she embodies **eros**—not merely romantic love but the fundamental principle of attraction, the force that draws beings together.

Aphrodite is **beauty incarnate**, but hers is not passive decoration—it is **active power**, the magnetism that compels desire, the force that disrupts order (including marriages) to serve passion.

## Key Myths

**Birth from the Sea:**
After Kronos castrated Uranus, the severed genitals fell into the sea, and from the foam Aphrodite emerged fully formed—the goddess born not from mother but from **violent separation and oceanic depths**, encoding desire as primal, chaotic, and autonomous.

**The Judgment of Paris:**
When Paris chose Aphrodite as most beautiful (over Hera and Athena), she promised him Helen—sparking the Trojan War. Aphrodite's gift of desire brings both ecstasy and destruction.

**Aphrodite and Ares:**
Aphrodite's most famous affair was with Ares (Mars), god of war—the union of **beauty and violence, desire and aggression**. When her husband Hephaestus trapped them in a net, the gods mocked them, yet the union reveals the inseparability of love and conflict.

**Aphrodite and Adonis:**
Aphrodite fell in love with the mortal Adonis, whose beauty was unmatched. When he was killed by a boar, anemone flowers sprang from his blood—encoding beauty as fleeting, desire as tragic, love as inherently wounded by mortality.

## Archetypal Significance

**The Principle of Eros:**
Aphrodite embodies **eros as cosmic force**—the attraction that draws opposites together, the desire that drives all creation. She is the yes that says "I want" without justification.

**Beauty as Power:**
Aphrodite reveals that **beauty is not passive but active**—it compels, magnetizes, disrupts. Her beauty starts wars, breaks marriages, undoes reason. She is the force that makes mortals and gods alike lose themselves.

**The Anima:**
In Jungian terms, Aphrodite is [[The Anima]]—the soul-image, the muse, the feminine principle that connects the masculine psyche to feeling, beauty, and relatedness.
