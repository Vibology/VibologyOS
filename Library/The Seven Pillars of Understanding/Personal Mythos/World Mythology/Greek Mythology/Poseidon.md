## Overview

**Poseidon** (Ποσειδῶν, Roman: **Neptune**) is the Olympian god of the **ocean, earthquakes, and horses**. Brother to Zeus and Hades, he rules the watery realm—not just seas and rivers, but the **emotional depths, the unconscious forces that surge and recede** beyond rational control.

Poseidon is called **"Earth-Shaker"** (*Enosichthon*)—the god who causes earthquakes by striking his trident against the earth. He represents the **unstable ground beneath consciousness**, the tectonic forces that can rupture stable structures without warning.

## Key Myths

**Division of the Cosmos:**
After defeating the Titans, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades drew lots to divide the cosmos. Zeus won the sky, Hades the underworld, and Poseidon the sea—though all three share dominion over the earth.

**Contest for Athens:**
Poseidon competed with Athena for patronage of Athens. He struck the Acropolis with his trident, creating a saltwater spring; Athena offered the olive tree. The citizens chose Athena's gift of peace and prosperity over Poseidon's gift of military power.

**Poseidon and Horses:**
Poseidon is the **creator of horses**—animals that embody untamed power, instinct, and speed. Horses are creatures of both earth (Poseidon as earth-shaker) and sea (waves as "white horses").

## Archetypal Significance

**The Unconscious Depths:**
Poseidon governs the **emotional and instinctual depths**—the oceanic unconscious that consciousness floats upon. He is the force beneath the surface, the undertow that can pull you under if you ignore its power.

**Earthquakes as Psychic Rupture:**
Poseidon's earthquakes encode **sudden upheavals of the unconscious**—trauma surfacing, repressed material erupting, the moment when the ground you thought was solid proves unstable.

**Lord of Horses:**
Horses represent **instinctual drives**—sexual energy, life force, the power that carries you forward but cannot be fully controlled. Poseidon tames horses, but they remain fundamentally wild.
