# Ares
*God of War — Raw Aggression and the Fury of Battle*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Ares** (Ἄρης, Roman: **Mars**) is the Olympian god of war—not strategy or victory (that is Athena's domain), but the **raw violence and bloodlust of combat**. He represents aggression in its purest form: the fury that erupts when boundaries are violated, the life force that fights to survive.

Unlike the Roman Mars (who was also a protector of agriculture and order), Greek Ares is dangerous, chaotic, and often despised even by other gods. Homer has Zeus tell Ares: *"To me you are the most hateful of all the gods who hold Olympus"* (Iliad, Book 5).

## Key Myths

**The Affair with Aphrodite:**
Ares's most famous myth is his adulterous affair with Aphrodite (Venus), wife of Hephaestus. Hephaestus trapped them in an invisible net and displayed them to the mocking gods—revealing the union of **desire and aggression**, beauty and violence.

**Ares in the Trojan War:**
Unlike Athena (who represents strategic warfare), Ares embodies the **chaos of the battlefield**. He fights for the Trojans but is wounded by Diomedes (with Athena's aid), fleeing to Olympus in humiliation.

**The Areopagus:**
The "Hill of Ares" in Athens was the site where Ares was tried by the gods for killing Halirrhothius (son of Poseidon) in defense of his daughter. He was acquitted—establishing the principle that **violence in defense of one's own is justified**.

## Archetypal Significance

**Raw Life Force:**
Ares is **unmediated aggression**—the body as weapon, the self as warrior. He is necessary for survival but dangerous when uncontrolled. The psyche without Ares collapses into passivity; the psyche possessed by Ares becomes the berserker.

**Shadow Integration:**
Ares represents the **aggressive instinct** Jung identified as essential for individuation. Denied, he becomes passive-aggression, resentment, and the victim who secretly craves violence. Integrated, he is courage, self-defense, and the capacity to fight for what matters.

**Ares and Aphrodite (Mars-Venus):**
The union of Ares and Aphrodite encodes the **syzygy of desire and assertion**—attraction and pursuit, receptivity and penetration, beauty and power.
