# Sol
*Sol Invictus — The Unconquered Sun*

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Sol** (Greek: **Helios**, Ἥλιος) is the Roman personification of the **sun itself**—the solar disk that crosses the sky daily, the light that cannot be defeated, the cosmic timekeeper. In late Roman tradition, **Sol Invictus** ("Unconquered Sun") became a major imperial cult, synthesizing solar worship across the empire.

Sol/Helios is distinct from [[Apollo]] (who is a god *associated* with solar qualities but not the sun itself). Sol is the **literal sun**—the physical and metaphysical light that sustains all life.

## Key Myths

**Helios and Phaethon:**
Helios's son Phaethon demanded to drive the solar chariot. Unable to control the horses, Phaethon nearly destroyed the earth before Zeus struck him down—encoding the danger of **unearned solar power**, hubris, and the necessity of discipline to wield consciousness.

**The All-Seeing Eye:**
Helios sees everything that occurs under his light. He witnessed Hades's abduction of Persephone and revealed it to Demeter. The sun is the **cosmic witness**, the eye of heaven that cannot be deceived.

**Sol Invictus (Imperial Cult):**
In late Rome (3rd-4th century CE), **Sol Invictus** became a major state cult, associated with emperors as solar representatives. Constantine initially honored Sol Invictus before converting to Christianity—and the Christian celebration of Christ's birth (December 25) corresponds to the Roman solar festival.

## Archetypal Significance

**The Unconquered Light:**
Sol Invictus represents the **solar principle as invincible**—the light that cannot be extinguished, the consciousness that endures through all trials. This became a symbol of imperial Rome's eternal nature.

**The Cosmic Witness:**
As the all-seeing eye, Sol embodies **consciousness as awareness**—the capacity to see, to know, to illuminate what is hidden. Nothing escapes the sun's gaze.

**Solar Kingship:**
Sol is the **divine model for earthly rulers**—constant, reliable, life-giving, yet capable of scorching destruction if approached without reverence.
