## Overview

**Hades** (Ἅιδης, Roman: **Pluto**) is the Olympian god of the **underworld**—the realm of the dead, the buried, the hidden. His name means "The Unseen One," and he rules the shadowy domain beneath the earth where souls journey after death.

Hades is not death itself (that is Thanatos) but the **king of the dead**—the one who receives souls, who guards the boundary between life and death, who governs the riches buried in the earth (hence the Roman name *Pluto*, "wealth").

## Key Myths

**The Rape of Persephone:**
Hades's most famous myth is the abduction of Persephone (Roman: Proserpina), daughter of Demeter. With Zeus's permission, Hades seized her and brought her to the underworld as his queen. Demeter's grief caused winter until Persephone's return—establishing the seasonal cycle of death and rebirth.

**Hades's Helm of Invisibility:**
During the Titanomachy, the Cyclopes forged a helmet for Hades that granted invisibility—the power to move unseen, to operate in darkness, to work beneath the surface where consciousness cannot perceive.

**Hades and Heracles:**
Heracles' final labor was to descend into the underworld and capture Cerberus (the three-headed hound). Hades permitted this on condition that Heracles use no weapons—establishing the principle that the underworld can be entered only through **surrender, not conquest**.

## Archetypal Significance

**The Shadow Realm:**
Hades governs the **personal and collective unconscious**—the buried material, the disowned aspects of self, the [[The Shadow|Shadow]] that must be confronted for wholeness. Descent into Hades is the *katabasis*: the hero's journey into the depths.

**Death and Rebirth:**
Hades is not evil (the Greeks did not demonize death)—he is **necessary transformation**. What dies in his realm can be reborn. The seed must be buried to sprout.

**Hidden Wealth:**
Pluto's association with wealth (*ploutos*) reveals that the underworld contains **hidden treasures**—both literal (minerals, gems buried in earth) and psychological (the gold in the shadow, the gifts waiting in what we most fear).
