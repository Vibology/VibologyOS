# Persephone
*Maiden and Queen — Goddess of Spring and the Underworld*

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Persephone** (Περσεφόνη, Roman: **Proserpina**) is the goddess who bridges **two worlds**: the upper realm of spring, flowers, and maiden innocence, and the underworld realm of death, darkness, and queenship. Known as **Kore** ("The Maiden") before her descent, she becomes **Persephone the Queen** after her abduction by Hades.

Her myth encodes the **death-rebirth cycle**—the necessary descent into darkness that precedes renewal, the loss of innocence that births wisdom, the transformation from maiden to sovereign.

## Key Myths

**The Abduction:**
Hades abducted Persephone while she gathered flowers in a meadow, dragging her to the underworld to become his queen. Her mother Demeter's grief caused the earth to become barren—winter as mourning, the world dying in the Mother's sorrow.

**The Pomegranate Seeds:**
Before Persephone could return to the upper world, Hades gave her pomegranate seeds to eat. Having consumed food of the underworld, she was bound to return—spending one-third (or half, depending on version) of the year below. This established the **seasonal cycle**: spring/summer when Persephone returns, fall/winter when she descends.

**Queen of the Underworld:**
Persephone is not merely Hades's victim—she becomes **Queen of the Underworld**, wielding power over the dead, administering justice, and guiding initiates through mysteries.

## Astrological Correspondence

- **Planet:** [[Pluto ♇]] (transformation, underworld), [[Moon ☽]] (maiden aspect)
- **Sign:** [[Scorpio ♏]] (death/rebirth, depth, intensity)
- **House:** [[8th House]] (transformation, crisis, shared resources)

## Archetypal Significance

**The Initiatory Descent:**
Persephone's abduction is not only trauma but **initiation**—the necessary loss of innocence that births mature consciousness. She descends as Kore (the girl) and returns as Persephone (the woman who knows death).

**The Death-Rebirth Cycle:**
Persephone embodies the **eternal return**: spring emerges from winter, life from death, resurrection from burial. She is the seed planted in darkness that breaks through earth to bloom.

**Maiden and Queen:**
Persephone holds the paradox of **innocence and sovereignty**—the flower-picking girl and the underworld queen are one being. She is simultaneously victim and ruler, abducted and enthroned.
