## Overview

**Zeus** (Ζεύς, Roman: **Jupiter**) is the king of the Olympian gods, ruler of the sky, wielder of the thunderbolt, and enforcer of cosmic justice. His name derives from the Proto-Indo-European root ***dyeu-** ("sky, daylight"), linking him to the primordial Sky Father archetype shared across Indo-European mythologies.

Zeus represents **sovereign authority tempered by law**—the principle that power must serve justice, not mere dominance. He is the protector of guests (*Zeus Xenios*), keeper of oaths (*Zeus Horkios*), and defender of cosmic order against chaos.

## Key Myths

**The Titanomachy:**
Zeus's rise to power begins with liberation. His father **Kronos** (Saturn) devoured his children to prevent the prophecy that one would overthrow him. Zeus alone escaped, hidden in a cave on Mount Ida, and returned to force Kronos to regurgitate his siblings. He led the Olympians in war against the Titans, establishing a new cosmic order.

**The Gigantomachy:**
Zeus defended the ordered cosmos against the earth-born Giants, who threatened to return the universe to primordial chaos. Victory came through divine law and strategic alliance, not brute force alone.

**Zeus as Protector of Hospitality:**
Zeus enforces *xenia* (sacred hospitality)—the law that guests and strangers must be protected. To violate hospitality is to offend Zeus directly.

## Archetypal Significance

**The Sky Father:**
Zeus embodies the **masculine principle of order, law, and transcendent authority**. He is the father who liberates rather than devours (unlike Kronos), establishing the rule of justice over tyranny.

**Expansive Generosity:**
Zeus's countless unions with goddesses and mortals encode the principle of **proliferation and dissemination**—scattering gifts widely, trusting the worthy will rise. The shadow is excess without discrimination.

**The Thunderbolt:**
Zeus's weapon is not the sword (Mars) but the thunderbolt—**judgment from above**, the sudden intervention of divine will that shatters false structures.
