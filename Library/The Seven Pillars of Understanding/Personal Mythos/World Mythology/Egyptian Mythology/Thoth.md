# Thoth
*Lord of Sacred Knowledge — Divine Scribe and Measurer of Time*

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Thoth** (Djehuty, Θώθ in Greek) is the Egyptian god of **writing, wisdom, magic, and measurement**. He is the divine scribe who records the deeds of the dead, the inventor of hieroglyphs, the measurer of time, and the patron of scribes, magicians, and those who seek hidden knowledge.

Thoth is often depicted as an **ibis-headed man** or as a **baboon**—animals associated with wisdom, vigilance, and the liminal hours of dawn. He is the **lunar god** who measures the months and regulates the cosmic order through precise calculation.

## Key Myths

**Thoth and the Calendar:**
Thoth won extra days from the moon god Khonsu through gambling, creating the **five epagomenal days** added to the 360-day year—allowing Nut (sky goddess) to give birth to Osiris, Isis, Set, Nephthys, and Horus the Elder.

**Weighing of the Heart:**
In the Hall of Ma'at (judgment of the dead), Thoth records the results as the deceased's heart is weighed against the feather of truth. If the heart is heavier (burdened with wrongdoing), it is devoured by Ammit. Thoth ensures **accurate accounting**—truth cannot be negotiated.

**Thoth as Mediator:**
Thoth mediates disputes between gods—most famously between Horus and Set. He is the voice of reason, the one who resolves conflicts through wisdom rather than violence.

## Archetypal Significance

**The Divine Scribe:**
Thoth represents the **power of the written word**—language as magic, naming as creation. Hieroglyphs (*medu netjer*, "words of the gods") are not mere symbols but **active forces** that bring reality into being.

**Measurement and Order:**
Thoth governs **measurement, calculation, and cosmic order**—the principle that the universe operates by law, that time can be tracked, that knowledge can be systematized. He is the patron of astrologers, mathematicians, and scientists.

**Hidden Knowledge:**
In Hellenistic and later Western esoteric traditions, Thoth became **Hermes Trismegistus** ("Thrice-Great Hermes")—the founder of alchemy, astrology, and the Hermetic tradition. The *Emerald Tablet* is attributed to him.
