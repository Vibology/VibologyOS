## Overview

**Isis** (Aset, Ἶσις in Greek) is one of the most powerful and enduring goddesses of ancient Egypt—the **Great Mother, the supreme magician, and the throne itself**. Her name means "throne" (*set*), and she is often depicted with a throne-shaped crown, encoding the principle that **sovereignty flows through the feminine**.

Isis is the devoted wife who resurrected Osiris, the protective mother who raised Horus in secret, and the magician whose power rivaled even Ra's. Her cult spread throughout the Greco-Roman world, becoming one of the most popular mystery religions of antiquity.

## Key Myths

**The Murder and Resurrection of Osiris:**
When Set murdered Osiris and scattered his body across Egypt, Isis searched tirelessly to recover the pieces. She reassembled him and used her magic to briefly restore him to life—conceiving Horus in this moment of resurrection. Isis is the **power of love that overcomes death**.

**The Secret Name of Ra:**
Isis tricked Ra into revealing his secret name by placing a serpent in his path. When Ra was bitten and in agony, Isis offered to heal him—but only if he revealed his true name (source of his power). By learning his name, Isis gained **power equal to the sun god's**.

**Protection of Horus:**
Isis hid the infant Horus in the papyrus marshes of the Nile delta, protecting him from Set's murderous rage. She is the **fierce mother** who will do anything to protect her child—using magic, deception, and relentless determination.

## Archetypal Significance

**The Great Mother:**
Isis embodies [[The Great Mother]]—the nurturing, protecting, life-giving feminine principle. She is the womb, the throne, the one who births and sustains.

**The Supreme Magician:**
Isis is **magic incarnate**—*heka* (Egyptian magic) flows through her words. She knows the secret names that command reality, the spells that resurrect the dead, the incantations that protect the vulnerable.

**Death and Resurrection:**
Isis is the power that **restores life from death**—not merely literal resurrection but the renewal that follows loss, the rebirth that emerges from mourning. She is the one who refuses to accept finality.
