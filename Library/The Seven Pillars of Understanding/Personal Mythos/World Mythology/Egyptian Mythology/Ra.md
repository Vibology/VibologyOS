# Ra
*The Sun God — Creator and King of Heaven*

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Ra** (Re, Rꜥ) is the ancient Egyptian sun god—the **supreme creator, the king of heaven, and the source of all life**. He is the solar disk that crosses the sky each day in his solar barque, battling the serpent Apophis each night in the underworld before being reborn at dawn.

Ra represents the **principle of solar consciousness**—the ordering light that brings form from chaos, the divine kingship that establishes ma'at (cosmic order), and the life-force that animates all existence.

## Key Myths

**Creation Through Self-Generation:**
In Heliopolitan theology, Ra (as Atum-Ra) created himself from the primordial waters of Nun—the principle of **self-generated existence**. From his own being, he created Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture), beginning the divine lineage.

**The Solar Journey:**
Each day, Ra travels across the sky in the *Mandjet* (morning boat) and through the underworld in the *Mesektet* (evening boat). During the night journey, he battles **Apophis** (chaos serpent)—the eternal struggle between order and dissolution.

**The Eye of Ra:**
Ra's eye (the solar disk) is a powerful, autonomous force—sometimes personified as the goddess Sekhmet or Hathor. When humanity rebelled against Ra, he sent his eye as **Sekhmet the lioness** to punish them—revealing the sun's capacity for both life-giving warmth and destructive fire.

**The Secret Name:**
[[Isis]] tricked Ra into revealing his secret name, stealing his power. This myth encodes the principle that **even solar consciousness has hidden depths**, that names contain power, and that the feminine principle (magic) can equal or surpass masculine authority (kingship).

## Archetypal Significance

**Solar Consciousness:**
Ra embodies the **solar principle**—the light of consciousness that names, orders, and creates form. He is the ego at its most beneficent: confident, life-giving, generative.

**The King Archetype:**
Ra is the **divine king**—the one who establishes order (ma'at), defeats chaos (Apophis), and serves as the model for earthly pharaohs. Kingship flows from the sun.

**Death and Rebirth:**
Ra's nightly journey through the underworld (Duat) and dawn rebirth encodes the **daily death-rebirth cycle**—consciousness descending into the unconscious and re-emerging renewed. This is individuation as daily practice.

**The Eye (Solar Consciousness as Weapon):**
The Eye of Ra represents consciousness as **active, penetrating force**—seeing as power, awareness as weapon. When unbalanced, it becomes destructive (Sekhmet).
