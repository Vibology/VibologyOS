# The Magdalene Path
*The Vertical Axis of Soul Ascent Through Conscious Love*

---
## Core Teaching

> *Vibology Synthesis: The following framework integrates Bourgeault's Magdalene scholarship with the Seven Pillars system.*

**The Magdalene Path** is the **vertical axis** (Z-axis) of the [[Seven-Coordinate Navigation]] system—the unifying **soul ascent principle** that integrates and illuminates all other wisdom traditions within [[Vibology]]. While the six horizontal pillars ([[Angelology]], [[Astrology]], Folklore, [[Human Design]], [[The Tarot]], [[The Window]]) provide structural frameworks for understanding consciousness, The Magdalene Path provides the **Anima**—the inward quest, the compass, the validation through embodied experience.

**The Central Teaching:** The path to divine union is not through transcendence **away from** the body, but through radical **embodiment**—the marriage of spirit and matter, consciousness and form, masculine and feminine within the individual soul. This is the **Fifth Way** or the **Path of Conscious Love** (Bourgeault, 109), characterized by three core practices:

1. **Kenosis** (Self-Emptying) - Letting go of egoic grasping to create space for the Divine (Bourgeault, 114)
2. **Singleness** (Ihidaya) - Inner integration where the soul becomes whole, undivided (Bourgeault, 97)
3. **Conscious Love** - The capacity to hold spiritual space for another through substituted love and sacred union

**Why "Magdalene"?**

[[Mary Magdalene - Apostle and Beloved|Mary Magdalene]] is the archetypal figure of this path—the **Apostle to the Apostles**, the **Beloved**, the **Witness**, the **Anointer**. She represents the transformed feminine consciousness that has achieved **singleness** (inner wholeness) and thus can enter the **Bridal Chamber** (sacred union with the Divine). She is Wisdom (Sophia) incarnate, the human expression of divine love moving between realms to reunite the "shards of light." The Gospel of Philip identifies her as Jesus's *koinonos* (companion/partner), a term implying equality and intimacy (Bourgeault, 107; Gospel of Philip, NHL).

---
## Gospel Foundation

### The Canonical Gospels

In the four canonical gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), Mary Magdalene appears at the **critical threshold moments**:

**The Crucifixion:** She stands at the cross when the male disciples flee, witnessing the ultimate kenosis—Jesus emptying himself completely (Mark 15:40, John 19:25)

**The Burial:** She observes where the body is laid, maintaining vigil (Mark 15:47)

**The Resurrection:** She is the **first witness** to the Risen Christ and is commissioned to announce the Good News to the apostles—thus earning the title **"Apostle to the Apostles"** (John 20:11-18)

**The Teaching:** Mary Magdalene demonstrates **steadfast presence** through death and transformation. She does not flee when faced with the dissolution of form. She witnesses, anoints, and carries the message of resurrection.

### The Wisdom Gospels (Gnostic Tradition)

The **Nag Hammadi** texts (discovered 1945) and the **Berlin Codex** reveal a different layer—Mary Magdalene as the **intimate companion** (koinonos) of Jesus and the disciple who **understands** what the male apostles cannot grasp.

**Gospel of Mary (2nd century):** Preserved in the Berlin Gnostic Codex (BG 8502,1); the original Greek text dates to the first half of the 2nd century (King, *Gospel of Mary of Magdala*, 2003).
- Mary receives private teaching from Jesus about the **nous** (mind/heart as organ of spiritual perception)—the Savior explains that one sees neither through soul nor spirit, but through the nous which exists "between the two" (Gospel of Mary, NHL)
- She stabilizes the disciples when they falter after the crucifixion
- Peter challenges her authority, but Levi defends her: "If the Savior made her worthy, who are you to reject her?"

**Gospel of Philip (3rd century):** Found in Nag Hammadi Codex II,3; likely translated from a Greek text written in the second half of the 3rd century CE, probably in Syria (NHL Introduction).
- Identifies Mary as Jesus' **koinonos** (companion/partner)—a term implying equality and intimacy
- Describes Jesus "kissing her often"—symbolic of the transmission of breath/spirit (pneuma); the manuscript is damaged at this point, with "mouth" being the standard reconstruction (Gospel of Philip, NHL)
- Introduces the **Bridal Chamber** as the central sacrament, surpassing baptism and eucharist
- Teaches that only those who have achieved **singleness** (internal wholeness) can enter the Bridal Chamber

**Gospel of Thomas (1st–2nd century):** Found in Nag Hammadi Codex II,2; considered one of the earliest non-canonical texts, potentially contemporaneous with the "Q" source (50–125 CE).
- Logion 114: Jesus will "make Mary male" so she can enter the Kingdom—interpreted as achieving **singleness** (the integration of masculine and feminine within), not a literal sex change but transformation into a "living spirit" or *anthropos* (Bourgeault, 97)

**The Pattern:** The Wisdom tradition portrays Mary Magdalene as the **exemplar of gnosis**—knowledge gained through direct experience and relationship, not through dogma or hierarchy.

### Medieval Mysticism: The Penitent Whore Myth

In 594 CE, **Pope Gregory I** conflated three separate figures into one in Homily 33 (Bourgeault, 2010):
- Mary Magdalene (witness to resurrection)
- The "sinful woman" who anoints Jesus' feet (Luke 7:36-50)
- Mary of Bethany (sister of Lazarus)

Gregory stated: "She whom Luke calls the sinful woman, whom John calls Mary, we believe to be the Mary from whom seven demons were ejected... And what did these seven demons signify if not all the vices?" This created the **"penitent prostitute"** narrative—Mary as the reformed sinner. While historically false, this myth **paradoxically preserved** the erotic and embodied nature of the Magdalene path within Christianity. The emphasis on **anointing** (a deeply sensual, intimate act) remained central.

**Medieval Mystics** adopted **bridal mysticism**—the soul as the bride seeking union with Christ. They drew heavily on the **Song of Songs** (attributed to Solomon), interpreting it as the love affair between the soul and God:

- **Bernard of Clairvaux** (12th century): Founder of "monastic love mysticism" and the Cistercian "school of love." Wrote eighty-six sermons on the Song of Songs, arguing that eros is the touchstone of spiritual transformation. "A cold heart cannot catch fire" from the text; one must love to understand it (Bourgeault, 2010).
- **Teresa of Ávila** (16th century): Her experience of the angel thrusting a flaming arrow into her heart represents "spiritual ecstasy"—she emphasized that real love of God consists not in "tear-shedding" or "spiritual sweetness" but in serving God with justice, fortitude, and humility.

### Contemporary Recovery: Cynthia Bourgeault

In the 21st century, scholars like **Karen King** and especially **Cynthia Bourgeault** have recovered the Magdalene tradition as a **coherent spiritual path**.

**Karen King's Contribution:** King introduced the Gospel of Mary in *The Nag Hammadi Library* (1990) and authored *The Gospel of Mary of Magdala: Jesus and the First Woman Apostle* (2003). She argues that "there was no such thing as Gnosticism" as a monolithic religion—the term was a category created by early heresy-hunters to define their own orthodoxy. She critiques the "master story" of Christianity (unbroken male apostolic succession) and dates the Gospel of Mary to the first half of the 2nd century.

**Bourgeault's Contribution:**
- *The Meaning of Mary Magdalene: Discovering the Woman at the Heart of Christianity* (Boston: Shambhala, 2010) - Comprehensive synthesis of canonical, gnostic, and medieval sources
- Identifies The Magdalene Path as the **"Fifth Way"** (p. 109)—distinct from the four traditional paths (Devotion, Knowledge, Action, Meditation)
- Proposes the formula **A = E × K** (Agape = Eros × Kenosis): Divine love is not separate from human passion; it is Eros transformed by self-emptying (p. 114)
- Emphasizes **kenosis** (self-emptying as "non-clinging" or "letting be," not ascetic renunciation), **singleness** (inner wholeness via *ihidaya*, p. 97), and **conscious partnership** as core practices
- Connects to **Boris Mouravieff's** description of the Fifth Way as an "esoteric shortcut" within Gurdjieff's Fourth Way tradition—a path of conscious love practiced in committed partnership

---
## The Fifth Way: Conscious Love

### The Four Traditional Ways (and Their Limits)

Gurdjieff defined the **Fourth Way** (or "Way of the Conscious Man") as a spiritual path practiced in the midst of ordinary life, distinct from the traditional paths (Bourgeault, 2010):

**Way of the Fakir** (Body/Asceticism): Mastery through physical discipline—fasting, flagellation, extreme practices. **Limit:** Disconnection from heart and mind.

**Way of the Monk** (Heart/Devotion): Mastery through prayer, worship, surrender to the Divine. **Limit:** Can become sentimental or dependent on external authority.

**Way of the Yogi** (Mind/Knowledge): Mastery through study, meditation, intellectual rigor. **Limit:** Can become dry, abstract, disconnected from embodiment.

**The Fourth Way** (Integration): Gurdjieff's path of working on all three centers (body/heart/mind) simultaneously while living in the world. **Advancement:** Brings practice into ordinary life.

### The Fifth Way: The Path of Relationship

Boris Mouravieff described the **Fifth Way** as a specific "esoteric shortcut" within the Fourth Way tradition. Unlike the solitary Fourth Way, the Fifth Way is a path of conscious love practiced in committed partnership (Bourgeault, 109).

**The Innovation:** The Fifth Way uses **intimate relationship** (romantic partnership, spiritual friendship, community) as the **crucible** for transformation. Rather than withdrawing to a monastery or ashram, practitioners work within the fire of daily connection. Bourgeault proposes that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were practitioners of this Fifth Way, using the friction and intimacy of their relationship to accelerate spiritual transformation.

**The Mechanics:**
1. **Two Whole Beings:** Each partner must first achieve **singleness** (inner integration)—you cannot seek completion in the other (Bourgeault, 97)
2. **Kenosis in Relationship:** Practicing radical self-emptying in the face of the beloved—letting go of control, defensiveness, egoic self-image. Kenosis involves the "willing surrender of attachment to the very thing(s) one holds most precious" (Bourgeault, 114)
3. **Substituted Love:** The capacity to "lay down your life" for another—not martyrdom, but holding spiritual space, standing in their place, reflecting their light
4. **The Bridal Chamber:** The union of two Single beings creates a **"third term"**—the Wedding Garment or Abler Soul—a unified consciousness greater than the sum of parts (Gospel of Philip, NHL; Bourgeault, 2010)

**Why "Fifth"?**

This path integrates all four previous ways (body, heart, mind, integration) **plus** the dimension of **eros** and **intimacy**. It is the most demanding because the mirror of relationship reveals **everything**—every shadow, every defensiveness, every unhealed wound.

## The Vertical Axis: Soul Ascent

> *Vibology Synthesis: The Z-axis framework is an original integration, mapping Bourgeault's Magdalene scholarship onto the Seven Pillars system.*

### The Z-Axis in Seven-Coordinate Navigation

While the six horizontal pillars provide **location** (where you are in the archetypal map), The Magdalene Path provides **direction** (the trajectory of ascent from material density to divine union).

**Horizontal Systems (X-Y Plane):**
- [[Angelology]] - Hierarchical consciousness patterns
- [[Astrology]] - Planetary timing and cosmic positioning
- Folklore - Cultural archetypal encoding (Jungian psychology, mythology)
- [[Human Design]] - Individual genetic imprinting and mechanical navigation
- [[The Tarot]] - Qabalistic pathways and archetypal progression
- [[The Window]] - Contemporary archetypal resonance (I-Ching framework)

**Vertical System (Z-Axis):**
- **The Magdalene Path** - Soul ascent from Base (material density) through the Abyss to Zenith (sanctification)

**The Integration:**

At any given moment, your consciousness can be mapped:
- **Location:** Where you are in the horizontal systems (e.g., Saturn in 10th House, Gate 51 defined, Tower card active)
- **Elevation:** Where you are on the vertical ascent (e.g., navigating the Lower Astral, confronting the False Self)

**Example Synthesis:**
- **Astrology:** Pluto transiting your natal Sun (death/rebirth)
- **Tarot:** Death card (XIII) active
- **Human Design:** Gate 51 (Shock) defined
- **Magdalene Path:** You are in the **Lower Astral** (Stage III)—confronting the seven demons (False Self system), preparing for the crossing of the Abyss

The horizontal systems **describe** what you're experiencing. The Magdalene Path **names the initiatory stage** and provides the practice (kenosis, singleness, anointing).

## The Eight Boughs of Ascent

The Magdalene Path presents the soul's ascent as **climbing the Great Tree**, a vision taught by [[Mary Magdalene - Apostle and Beloved|Mary Magdalene]] in **The Gospel of the Beloved Companion** (de Quillan, Ch. 42). In this vision, the Master (Jesus) shows Miryam (Mary) a great tree rooted in the earth (the body) and extending upward through five regions of humanity to the crown (the kingdom of the Spirit). One must ascend this tree to know the truth of eternal life. The tree has **eight great boughs**, each bearing specific "fruit" (virtue) that must be eaten in fullness. Between each bough stands a **guardian** (shadow/power) who challenges the soul.

#### The Structure
- **The Fruit** - Virtue to be integrated
- **The Shadow** - What blocks ascent
- **The Guardian** - The power confronted at the gate
- **The Practice** - Apophatic denial: *"I deny you. You have no part in me."*

### The Eight Boughs (Summary):

**First Bough: The Foundation**
- Fruit: Love and Compassion
- Shadow: Judgment and Wrath
- Guardian: The Lord of Wrath

**Second Bough: The Mind**
- Fruit: Wisdom and Understanding
- Shadow: Ignorance and Intolerance
- Guardian: The Voice of Ignorance

**Third Bough: The Ego/Self**
- Fruit: Honor and Humility
- Shadow: Duplicity and Arrogance
- Guardian: Arrogance (who shouts "You are not worthy!")

**Fourth Bough: The Flesh** (The Abyss)
- Fruit: Strength and Courage
- Shadow: Weakness of the flesh and the illusion of Fear
- Guardian: The Master of the World (The Deceiver)
- **The Crossing:** Passing through the "hardness of flesh"—the soul knows itself as "child of the living Spirit"

**Fifth Bough: The Awakening**
- Fruit: Clarity and Truth
- Transformation: The soul knows itself for the first time; the voice of the world becomes **Silence**

**Sixth Bough: Healing**
- Fruit: Power and Healing
- Function: Healing your own soul, making it ready for the final ascent

**Seventh Bough: Illumination**
- Fruit: Light and Goodness
- Transformation: The soul turns to **fire** and flies upward in flames

**Eighth Bough: The Apex**
- Fruit: Grace and Beauty of the Spirit
- Vision: The soul is embraced by the Spirit (Wisdom/Sophia) and realizes: **"I AM"**
- The Endpoint: *"Now you have become the completion of completions"*—silent restfulness in the Eternity of time

**The Seven Powers of Wrath** (from The Gospel of Mary, NHL): In the Gospel of Mary, the soul encounters the fourth power (Wrath), which manifests in seven forms. The guardians are not external demons but the **False Self System**:
1. Darkness
2. Desire (Craving)
3. Ignorance
4. The Excitement of Death (Craving for Death)
5. The Kingdom of the Flesh (Enslavement to the Body)
6. The Foolish Wisdom of Flesh (False Peace of the Flesh)
7. The Wrathful Wisdom (Compulsion of Rage)

These must be denied through **apophasis** (negation) at each bough.

**See:** [[The Eight Boughs of Ascent]] for complete treatment.

## Core Practices

### Kenosis: Self-Emptying

**Etymology:** Greek *kenosis* (κένωσις) - "emptying," derived from Philippians 2:6 (Bourgeault, 114)

**The Practice:** Letting go of egoic grasping—control, defensiveness, self-image, the need to be right. Bourgeault defines kenosis not as ascetic renunciation, but as "non-clinging" or "letting be" (Bourgeault, 114). Kenosis is **not** repression or self-annihilation. It is the **relaxation of the grip** on desires, allowing abundance to flow through. It functions as a tool of perception: by releasing the ego's grasp, one clears the lens of the heart to perceive divine abundance.

#### How It Works
1. **Notice the Constriction:** When you feel fear, craving, or resistance, pause
2. **Name It:** "I am gripping. I am clinging."
3. **Release:** Not by pushing away the desire, but by **opening the hand**—allowing it to be there without grasping
4. **Abundance Emerges:** What was obscured by grasping becomes visible—the love, the spaciousness, the abundance that is already present

**Application:** Kenosis is practiced moment-to-moment in daily life—in conflict with a partner, in anxiety about work, in attachment to outcomes. It is the **discipline of letting be**.

**See:** [[Kenosis - The Path of Self-Emptying]]

### Singleness (Ihidaya): Inner Wholeness

**Etymology:** Syriac *ihidaya* (ܝܚܝܕܝܐ) - "single one" or "undivided." Bourgeault argues that this Aramaic term applied to Jesus refers to unitive consciousness or non-duality, not celibacy (Bourgeault, 97).

**The Practice:** Becoming whole within—integrating the masculine and feminine, the vertical and horizontal, the conscious and unconscious. A Single being is **not** celibate or alone; they are **internally complete**, not seeking external validation or completion. It is the state of the *anthropos* (fully realized human) where binaries—such as male/female or inner/outer—are integrated into a single whole. One becomes "single" when the heart is unified, regardless of marital status (Bourgeault, 97).

#### How It Works
1. **Witness Consciousness:** Develop an inner observer—the part of you that is **not** identified with emotions, thoughts, or roles
2. **Integration:** Recognize that you contain both masculine (logos, structure, direction) and feminine (eros, flow, receptivity)
3. **Qualification:** Only a Single being can enter the **Bridal Chamber**—if you enter seeking completion from another, it is merely "marriage" (egoic partnership), not sacred union (Gospel of Philip, NHL)

**Application:** Singleness is the prerequisite for **conscious partnership**. You work on yourself first—therapy, shadow work, meditation, embodiment practices—until you are no longer desperate for the other to fill your void.

**See:** [[The Bridal Chamber and Sacred Union]]

### Substituted Love: Holding the Post

**The Practice:** "Laying down your life" for another—not martyrdom, but **exchanging places**. Standing in the beloved's place to bear their burden, reflect their light, or hold space when they cannot.

#### How It Works
1. **Total Presence:** When the beloved is in pain, fear, or confusion, you **do not** fix, advise, or rescue
2. **Stand In Their Place:** Energetically, you imagine yourself **as them**—feeling what they feel, seeing from their perspective
3. **Reflect Light:** You hold the truth of their wholeness when they cannot see it themselves
4. **The Abler Soul:** This creates a "third term"—a unified field of consciousness greater than either individual

**Application:** Substituted love is most commonly practiced in **romantic partnership**, but also in spiritual friendship, parent-child relationships, and community. It requires absolute trust and the surrender of the egoic need to be "right" or "superior."

**See:** [[Anointing and Substituted Love]]

### The Bridal Chamber: Sacred Union

In the Gospel of Philip, the Bridal Chamber is the central metaphor for the highest state of initiation and union. Philip lists five sacraments: Baptism, Anointing (Chrism), Eucharist, Restoration to Fullness of Being, and the Bridal Chamber—which is identified as the "Holy of Holies" (Gospel of Philip, NHL).

**The Practice:** The union of two **Single** (whole) beings that creates a "Wedding Garment"—a unified consciousness or "Abler Soul" that serves the Divine.

**The Qualification:** The Gospel of Philip states: "Let not the Bridal Chamber be for animals, slaves, or harlots; but it is for free men and virgins." Bourgeault interprets "virginity" here not as physical celibacy, but as "singleness"—a state of inner integrity where one is no longer divided by the false self. If you enter seeking validation, completion, or security from the other, it is merely "marriage," not the Bridal Chamber (Bourgeault, 97; Gospel of Philip, NHL).

**The Wedding Garment:** This refers to the "abler soul" (or subtle body) generated by the union of the lovers. It is described as a "flesh within the flesh" or a "resurrection body" built through kenotic love and the alchemical exchange of energies in partnership. This "garment" allows the consciousness developed in the partnership to survive death as a permanent field of creative love (Bourgeault, 2010).

**The Mechanics:**
1. **Eucharistic Sex:** Sexual union becomes a sacrament—"This is my body, given for you." Total vulnerability, total surrender.
2. **Transparency:** No hidden agendas, no defensiveness. Each sees and is seen completely.
3. **Spiritual Procreation:** The union generates "children of the light"—wisdom, creative power, healing capacity—not through biological reproduction but through alchemical transformation. In Philip, "the perfect conceive and give birth" via a kiss, sharing the same breath/spirit (Gospel of Philip, NHL).
4. **Cosmic Service:** The couple leaves the Bridal Chamber not for personal bliss but as **instruments** for collective transformation.

**See:** [[The Bridal Chamber and Sacred Union]]

## The Magdalene Path and the Other Pillars

> *Vibology Synthesis: The following cross-pillar mappings are original integrations, correlating Magdalene ascent stages with other systems in the Seven Pillars framework.*

### Angelology: The Angelic Governors

The **30 Enochian Aethyrs** (heavens) are governed by **Angelic Intelligences**. As you ascend through the stages, you invoke and work with these beings:

- **Base (TEX-BAG):** Governed by Powers and Principalities—grounding forces
- **Lower Astral (LIN-ICH):** Governed by Angels of transformation—Azrael (death), Raphael (healing)
- **The Abyss (ZAX):** Guarded by Choronzon (disperser)—requires the virtue of [[Temperance (XIV)]]
- **Zenith (LIL-ZOM):** Governed by Seraphim—the "Holy Living Creatures," pure Mind of God

**Integration:** The Magdalene Path provides the **human journey** through these realms. [[Angelology]] provides the **map and guardians**.

### Tarot: The Major Arcana as Milestones

Each stage of ascent corresponds to a **Major Arcana Key**:

- **Base:** [[The Devil (XV)]] (XV) - Bondage to materialism
- **Gate:** [[The Star (XVII)]] (XVII) - Hope, guidance, direction
- **Lower Astral:** [[Death (XIII)]] (XIII) - Death of the false self
- **Abyss:** [[Temperance (XIV)]] (XIV) - Balancing forces to cross Choronzon
- **Higher Astral:** [[Wheel of Fortune (X)]] (X) - Cycles of manifestation, clarity
- **Zenith:** [[The World (XXI)]] (XXI) - Completion, sanctification

**Integration:** Tarot provides the **archetypal images** of each stage. The Magdalene Path provides the **lived experience**.

### Human Design: The 28-Day Lunar Cycle

For those with **undefined Head and Ajna centers** (particularly [[Reflector|Reflectors]]), the **28-day Lunar Cycle** is the mechanical bridge to wisdom. The Moon moves through all 64 Gates in ~28 days, allowing the individual to "sample" all frequencies before making a major decision.

#### The Practice
1. **Wait 28 days** before making a significant choice
2. **Talk to others** during this cycle—not for advice, but to hear your own truth reflected
3. **Notice patterns**—transient emotions filter out, leaving deep knowing

**Integration:** The Lunar Cycle is a **temporal rhythm** for accessing the Magdalene Path wisdom when inner authority is unclear.

**See:** [[Practices and the Lunar Cycle]]

### The Window: Contemporary Archetypal Interface

[[The Window]] provides the **contemporary lens** for ancient wisdom—the I-Ching hexagrams as modern archetypal patterns. The Magdalene Path moves **through** these archetypes as stages of transformation.

**Example:** Hexagram 23 (Splitting Apart) corresponds to the **Lower Astral**—the dismantling of the false self.

---
## Kenotic Descent

### 1. Spiritual Bypassing

**The Danger:** Using the language of "letting go" or "kenosis" to **avoid** difficult emotions, conflict, or responsibility.

**Example:** "I'm practicing non-attachment" becomes an excuse for emotional unavailability or refusal to commit.

**Antidote:** True kenosis requires **full engagement** first. You cannot let go of what you have not fully felt or lived. Embodiment precedes transcendence.

### 2. The Penitent Whore Distortion

**The Danger:** Internalizing the patriarchal myth—believing that sexuality is "sinful" and must be "redeemed" through suffering.

**Example:** Women seeking spiritual validation through sexual purity or martyrdom.

**Antidote:** Reclaim the **anointing**—sexuality as **sacred**, not shameful. The Magdalene tradition honors eros as a pathway to gnosis.

### 3. Codependency Disguised as Sacred Union

**The Danger:** Entering partnership seeking **completion** from the other, calling it "Bridal Chamber" when it is merely egoic attachment.

**Example:** Two incomplete people merging in **fusion**, losing boundaries, calling it "sacred union."

**Antidote:** **Singleness first**. Do the inner work to become whole. Only then can you enter conscious partnership.

### 4. Premature Abyss Crossing

**The Danger:** Attempting to "cross the Abyss" before completing the **Lower Astral purification**—leading to spiritual inflation or psychosis.

**Example:** Using psychedelics or intense practices to force transcendence without integrating shadow.

**Antidote:** Respect the **sequence**. The Lower Astral (facing the seven demons) must be navigated before the Abyss. Shortcuts bypass necessary transformation.
