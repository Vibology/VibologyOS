## Overview

**Contemplative Prayer** is a form of Christian mystical prayer characterized by **silence, stillness, and wordless presence** before God. Unlike petitionary prayer (asking) or intercessory prayer (praying for others), contemplative prayer seeks **union with the divine** through receptive waiting.

Forms include:
- **Centering Prayer** (Thomas Keating, Basil Pennington)
- **The Prayer of Quiet** (Teresa of Ávila)
- **Hesychasm** (Eastern Orthodox practice using the Jesus Prayer)

Contemplative prayer is the Christian equivalent of meditation—a descent into the **heart center**, where the ego is silenced and the soul rests in divine love.
