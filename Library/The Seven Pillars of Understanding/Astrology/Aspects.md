# Aspects
*The Geometry of Relationship*

## What Are Aspects?

**Aspects** are angular relationships between planets in the natal chart or by transit. They reveal how planetary archetypes *interact*—whether they reinforce, challenge, or integrate one another. Aspects are not "good" or "bad" but **dynamic**: some create flow, others create friction, and friction is often the catalyst for growth.

## The Five Major Aspects

Lilly describes five primary configurations used in judgment: conjunction, sextile, square, trine, and opposition.[^1]

### ☌ Conjunction (0°)
**Archetypal Meaning:** Unity, fusion, the collision of two forces into one stream.

The conjunction is **bodily meeting**—two planets occupying the same zodiacal degree.[^1] This is not relationship but *identity*: the planets become indistinguishable, their themes inseparable. Whether this is harmonious or discordant depends on the planets involved. Lilly writes that conjunction "is good with good planets and evil with evil planets."[^1] Sun conjunct [[Jupiter ♃]] is expansive confidence; [[Saturn ♄]] conjunct [[Moon ☽]] is emotional constriction.

[^1]: Lilly, *Christian Astrology*, Book 2 (aspects: conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition)

**Psychological Function:** The conjunction reveals where consciousness has *no distance* from experience—no observer, only immersion.

---
### ☍ Opposition (180°)
**Archetypal Meaning:** Polarity, projection, the mirror of shadow.

The opposition is **"perfect hatred"**[^2]—two planets facing each other across the chart, each pulling in opposite directions. This is the aspect of [[Libra ♎]] and the [[7th House]]: the recognition that self exists only in relationship to other. Oppositions force *integration*: you cannot resolve the tension by choosing one pole. You must hold both.

[^2]: Lilly, *Christian Astrology*, Book 2 (opposition as "perfect hatred or enmity"; Ptolemy classifies as "discordant")

**Psychological Function:** The opposition is the **[[Shadow]] made visible**—what you reject in yourself, you encounter in the other.

---
### △ Trine (120°)
**Archetypal Meaning:** Harmony, ease, the gift that requires no effort.

The trine is an aspect of **"perfect love"**[^3]—connecting planets in the same **element** (Fire, Earth, Air, Water), creating natural flow. This is the aspect of talent, grace, and—if unexamined—complacency. Trines are blessings, but blessings can become prisons if they are never tested.

[^3]: Lilly, *Christian Astrology*, Book 2 (trine as "perfect love, unity, and friendship"; Ptolemy classifies as "harmonious")

**Psychological Function:** The trine reveals **where you coast**—and where you might need to *choose* difficulty to grow.

---
### □ Square (90°)
**Archetypal Meaning:** Tension, crisis, the ordeal that forges character.

The square is **"imperfect enmity"**[^4]—two planets at cross-purposes, each demanding incompatible responses. This is the aspect of the [[Cardinal Cross]]: the pressure to *act*, to resolve, to build despite resistance. Squares show difficulty but not impossibility.[^4] Squares are uncomfortable, but they are the primary engine of development.

[^4]: Lilly, *Christian Astrology*, Book 2 (square as "imperfect enmity"; Ptolemy classifies as "discordant")

**Psychological Function:** The square is the **call to mastery**—the place where ease ends and discipline begins.

---
### ⚹ Sextile (60°)
**Archetypal Meaning:** Opportunity, cooperation, the bridge between elements.

The sextile is an aspect of **"imperfect love or friendship"**[^5]—connecting planets in compatible (but not identical) elements, creating *potential* for harmony. Unlike the trine, the sextile requires conscious activation—it is opportunity, not inevitability.

[^5]: Lilly, *Christian Astrology*, Book 2 (sextile as "imperfect love")

**Psychological Function:** The sextile reveals **where effort yields reward**—the skill that, once learned, becomes second nature.

---
## Minor Aspects

While the five major aspects govern the chart's primary dynamics, minor aspects add **nuance**. Lilly acknowledges these "new" aspects introduced by Kepler, noting that he seldom uses them in general questions but does utilize them in nativities (birth charts) for directions.[^7]

- **Semisextile (30°):** Subtle adjustment, the need for conscious integration
- **Semisquare (45°):** Irritation, low-level friction
- **Quintile (72°):** Creative genius, the gift that defies category
- **Sesquiquadrate (135°):** Restlessness, the urge to act without clear target
- **Quincunx/Inconjunct (150°):** Incompatibility, the demand to reconcile the irreconcilable

Minor aspects function as **psychological undertones**—felt more than seen.

## Orbs: The Sphere of Influence

An **orb** is the range within which an aspect remains active. Traditional orbs vary by planet.[^6]

| Planet                | Orb Range |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| [[Sun ☉]]               | 15°–17°   |
| [[Moon ☽]]              | 12°–12.5° |
| [[Saturn ♄]]            | 9°–10°    |
| [[Jupiter ♃]]           | 9°–12°    |
| [[Mars ♂]], [[Mercury ☿]] | 7°–7.5°   |
| [[Venus ♀]]             | 7°–8°     |

The closer to exactitude (0° orb), the more intense the aspect's expression. To determine if two planets are in aspect, add their respective orbs together and divide by two (the "moiety"). If the distance between them is within that half-sum, they are in aspect.[^6]

## Psychological & Jungian Depth

Aspects are the **conversations** between planetary archetypes within the psyche. They reveal:
- **Integration** (trines, sextiles): where psychic energy flows without obstruction
- **Tension** (squares, oppositions): where growth is demanded through crisis
- **Fusion** (conjunctions): where differentiation has not occurred—or where synthesis is achieved

In Jungian terms, hard aspects (square, opposition) correlate with [[Shadow]] material: the parts of self that must be *worked* rather than expressed naturally. Soft aspects (trine, sextile) correlate with the integrated ego—but if over-relied upon, they can become defenses against growth.

---
## Esoteric Significance

Aspects are the **geometry of fate**—the angles through which archetypal forces meet and either amplify or neutralize one another. In [[Human Design]], aspects between transiting planets and natal gates activate specific themes, creating the "neutrino weather" that conditions experience.

The work is not to eliminate hard aspects but to **consciously engage** them—to transform tension into creative force, opposition into synthesis.

---
## Invitation for Contemplation

Where in your chart do you feel the most **friction**—and have you mistaken that friction for failure, rather than recognizing it as the forge?

Aspects teach that ease is not always growth. Sometimes, the square is the call. Sometimes, the opposition is the mirror. And sometimes, the conjunction is the annihilation that precedes rebirth.
