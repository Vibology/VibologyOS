# Aspects
*The Geometry of Relationship*

---
## What Are Aspects?

**Aspects** are angular relationships between planets in the natal chart or by transit. They reveal how planetary archetypes *interact*—whether they reinforce, challenge, or integrate one another. Aspects are not "good" or "bad" but **dynamic**: some create flow, others create friction, and friction is often the catalyst for growth.

## The Five Major Aspects

Lilly describes five primary configurations used in judgment: conjunction, sextile, square, trine, and opposition.[^1]

### ☌ Conjunction (0°)
**Archetypal Meaning:** Unity, fusion, the collision of two forces into one stream.

The conjunction is **bodily meeting**—two planets occupying the same zodiacal degree.[^1] This is not relationship but *identity*: the planets become indistinguishable, their themes inseparable. Whether this is harmonious or discordant depends on the planets involved. Lilly writes that conjunction "is good with good planets and evil with evil planets."[^1] Sun conjunct [[Jupiter ♃]] is expansive confidence; [[Saturn ♄]] conjunct [[Moon ☽]] is emotional constriction.
