# Transits and Timing
*The Neutrino Weather*

## What Are Transits?

**Transits** are the real-time movement of planets through the zodiac, creating angular relationships (aspects) to natal positions. Where the natal chart is the **blueprint**, transits are the **weather**—the conditioning field that activates, tests, or reveals latent potentials.

In [[Human Design]], transits are described as "local programming agents"[^1]—they carry information via the neutrino stream, temporarily activating gates and centers in the BodyGraph. Transits do not *cause* events—they **reveal** what is already present, waiting for the right conditions to emerge.
