# The Natal Chart
*Celestial Snapshot at the Moment of Birth*

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

The **Natal Chart** (also called the birth chart or horoscope) is the fundamental document of astrological analysis—a two-dimensional map of the heavens as seen from the exact location and moment of an individual's birth. It captures the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and mathematical points (Ascendant, Midheaven, lunar nodes) relative to the zodiac and the local horizon.

The natal chart is the **Algorithm** of astrological practice—the fixed, calculable structure from which all interpretation proceeds. Unlike [[Transits and Timing|transits]] (which track ongoing planetary movement), the natal chart is static: a permanent signature imprinted at the first breath.

## Components

### The Planets
Celestial bodies representing psychological functions and drives:

| Planet | Function | Archetype |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Sun | Core identity, vitality | The Self, the Hero |
| Moon | Emotional nature, instinct | The Mother, the Soul |
| Mercury | Communication, thinking | The Messenger, the Mind |
| Venus | Values, relating, pleasure | The Lover, the Artist |
| Mars | Action, drive, assertion | The Warrior, the Will |
| Jupiter | Expansion, meaning, belief | The King, the Teacher |
| Saturn | Structure, limitation, mastery | The Elder, the Judge |
| Uranus | Innovation, disruption | The Rebel, the Awakener |
| Neptune | Transcendence, imagination | The Mystic, the Dreamer |
| Pluto | Transformation, power | The Destroyer, the Regenerator |

### The Signs
The twelve zodiacal signs through which planets express:
- **Cardinal** (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn) — Initiating
- **Fixed** (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius) — Sustaining
- **Mutable** (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces) — Adapting

### The Houses
Twelve sectors of the chart representing life domains:
- Houses 1–6: Personal sphere (self, resources, communication, home, creativity, service)
- Houses 7–12: Interpersonal/transpersonal sphere (partnership, transformation, philosophy, career, community, unconscious)

### The Aspects
Angular relationships between planets indicating how energies interact:
- **Conjunction** (0°) — Fusion, intensification
- **Opposition** (180°) — Tension, awareness
- **Trine** (120°) — Harmony, flow
- **Square** (90°) — Challenge, growth
- **Sextile** (60°) — Opportunity, cooperation

## Calculating the Chart

Required data:
1. **Date of birth** (determines planetary positions in signs)
2. **Time of birth** (determines houses and angles)
3. **Location of birth** (determines local horizon and house cusps)

Without accurate birth time, the Ascendant and house positions remain unknown—significantly limiting interpretation.

## Reading the Chart

Interpretation proceeds through layers:
1. **Sun, Moon, Ascendant** — The core triad of identity
2. **Planetary placements** — Functions in signs and houses
3. **Aspects** — Relationships between functions
4. **Patterns** — Stelliums, T-squares, grand trines, etc.
5. **Rulers and dispositors** — Chains of influence
