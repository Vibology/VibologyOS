# Divination
*The Art of Tarot Reading*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Divination** is the practice of using Tarot cards as an oracular instrument—drawing cards to gain insight into questions, situations, or the unfolding of time. Unlike [[Pathworking]] (which uses cards as doorways for inner journeying) or study (which analyzes symbolic correspondences), divination is the **dialogical encounter** between questioner, cards, and the imaginal realm.

Tarot divination operates on the principle of **synchronicity**—the meaningful coincidence between inner psychological states and outer events. The cards drawn are not "random" in the mechanistic sense but reflect the constellation of psychic forces active at the moment of the question.

## The Reading Process

### 1. Preparation
- Clear and consecrate the space
- Center the mind; release attachment to specific outcomes
- Shuffle while holding the question

### 2. The Question
- Formulate clearly (open-ended questions yield richer readings)
- Avoid yes/no framing when possible
- The question shapes the field

### 3. The Spread
- Select appropriate spread for the question type
- Draw cards into positions
- Allow initial impressions before analysis

### 4. Interpretation
- Read each card in position context
- Note relationships between cards (elemental, numerical, visual)
- Synthesize into coherent narrative

### 5. Integration
- Offer the reading without attachment
- Allow the querent to find their own meaning
- Divination reveals possibilities, not fixed fate

## Divination Ethics

- **Consent:** Read only for those who request it
- **Boundaries:** Avoid medical, legal, or professional advice
- **Empowerment:** Frame readings to support agency, not dependency
- **Honesty:** Deliver difficult messages with compassion, not avoidance
- **Humility:** The cards suggest; they do not command

## Theoretical Foundations

**Synchronicity (Jung):** Meaningful coincidence without causal connection. The cards mirror psychic reality.

**Projective Hypothesis:** The reader projects unconscious contents onto ambiguous imagery, revealing what is already present but unrecognized.

**Archetypal Resonance:** The cards depict universal patterns; readings identify which archetypes are active.
