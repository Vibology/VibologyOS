## Overview

**Merkabah Mysticism** (Hebrew: *Merkavah*, מרכבה, "Chariot") is an early form of Jewish mysticism (c. 100 BCE – 1000 CE) focused on visionary ascent through the **seven heavenly palaces** (*Hekhalot*) to behold the **Throne of God** and the divine **Chariot** described in Ezekiel 1.

Merkabah practice involved intense meditation, fasting, prayer, and recitation of divine names to achieve ecstatic states and angelic visions. It is a precursor to later Qabalistic mysticism.
