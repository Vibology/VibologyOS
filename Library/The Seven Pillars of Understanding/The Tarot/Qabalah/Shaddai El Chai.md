## Overview

**Shaddai El Chai** (Hebrew: שדי אל חי, "Almighty Living God") is the **Divine Name** associated with **[[Yesod]]** (Foundation), the ninth Sephirah on the Tree of Life—the sphere of the Moon, the astral plane, dreams, and the etheric foundation of material reality.

The name combines:
- **Shaddai** (שדי) — "Almighty" or "The Sufficient One," an ancient divine name associated with fertility and sustenance
- **El Chai** (אל חי) — "Living God," emphasizing the life force that animates creation

Yesod channels the combined energies of the upper Sephiroth into [[Malkuth]]. Shaddai El Chai represents the **living, generative power** that sustains the material world from the astral plane. [[Gabriel]], the Archangel of Yesod, serves this name.
