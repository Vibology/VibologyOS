## Overview

**Shekinah** (Hebrew: שכינה, *Shekhinah* — "dwelling" or "presence") is the **Divine Presence** in Jewish mysticism—the aspect of God that **dwells within creation**, particularly associated with the feminine and with [[Malkuth]] (Kingdom), the tenth Sephirah. The Shekinah is not a separate goddess but the **immanent face of the One God**—the Infinite made tangible, the Transcendent made near.

The term derives from the Hebrew root *sh-k-n* (שכן), "to dwell," as in the Tabernacle (*mishkan*) where God's presence dwelt among Israel. The Shekinah is God **with us**, God **in exile with us**, God **in the body, in the world, in matter**.

## Key Associations

- **Malkuth:** The Shekinah dwells in Malkuth, the Kingdom—the material world, the body, the Bride
- **Exile and Return:** When Israel is exiled, the Shekinah goes with them; redemption is the reunion of God with Shekinah
- **The Feminine:** The Shekinah is the "Queen" to God's "King," the Bride of the cosmic marriage
- **[[Sandalphon]]:** The Archangel of Malkuth, who receives prayers and weaves them into a garment for the Shekinah
- **[[Gabriel]]:** Mediates the Shekinah's descent into matter (as in the Annunciation)
