## Overview

**YHVH Tzabaoth** (Hebrew: יהוה צבאות, "Lord of Hosts") is the **Divine Name** associated with **[[Netzach]]** (Victory), the seventh Sephirah on the Tree of Life—the sphere of Venus, emotion, desire, beauty, and the life force that endures.

The name combines:
- **YHVH** (יהוה) — The Tetragrammaton, the ineffable four-letter name of God
- **Tzabaoth** (צבאות) — "Hosts" or "Armies," the celestial legions

Where [[Elohim Tzabaoth]] at Hod commands through form and intellect, YHVH Tzabaoth at Netzach commands through **desire, passion, and the attractive force of love**. The divine hosts here are the forces of nature, beauty, and creative life. [[Haniel]], the Archangel of Netzach, serves this name.
