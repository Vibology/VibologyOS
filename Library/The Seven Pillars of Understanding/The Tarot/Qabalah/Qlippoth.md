# The Qlippoth
*The Shells of Fallen Light*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

The **Qlippoth** (Hebrew: קליפות, singular Qlippah, meaning "shells" or "husks") are the shadow or inverted aspects of the [[Sephiroth]]—the realms of unbalanced force that exist as the "other side" of the [[Tree of Life]]. They represent divine energy that has become distorted, excessive, or cut off from its source.

In Qabalistic cosmology, the Qlippoth are not simply "evil" but **necessary counterweights**—the shells that remain when the light withdraws, the forms that persist after spirit departs. They are the consequence of the **shattering of the vessels** (Shevirat HaKelim) in which the original Sephiroth could not contain the divine light.

## The Qlippothic Tree

Each Sephira has a corresponding Qlippah:

| Sephira | Qlippah | Translation | Nature |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Kether | Thaumiel | Twins of God | Duality where unity should reign |
| Chokmah | Ghagiel | Hinderers | Wisdom become cunning |
| Binah | Satariel | Concealers | Understanding become occultation |
| Chesed | Gamchicoth | Devourers | Mercy become indulgence |
| Geburah | Golachab | Burners | Strength become cruelty |
| Tiphareth | Tagiriron | Disputers | Beauty become pride |
| Netzach | A'arab Zaraq | Ravens of Dispersion | Victory become lust |
| Hod | Samael | Poison of God | Intellect become deception |
| Yesod | Gamaliel | Obscene Ones | Foundation become corruption |
| Malkuth | Lilith | Night Specter | Kingdom become exile |

## Psychological Interpretation

From a Jungian perspective, the Qlippoth represent the **Shadow aspects** of consciousness:

- **Thaumiel:** Ego inflation, identifying as God
- **Golachab:** Righteous cruelty, the inner tyrant
- **Gamaliel:** Repressed sexuality, unconscious drives

Working with the Qlippoth (carefully) can be a form of shadow integration—confronting the distorted aspects of each Sephirothic energy.

## Cautions

Qlippothic work is traditionally considered **dangerous**:
- Not for beginners
- Requires solid grounding in the "Day side" of the Tree
- Risk of inflation, obsession, or destabilization
- Should be approached with humility and guidance
