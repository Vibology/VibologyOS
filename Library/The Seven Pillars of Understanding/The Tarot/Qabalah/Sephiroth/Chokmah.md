# Chokmah
*Wisdom — The First Movement of Creation*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

**Chokmah** (Hebrew: חכמה, "Wisdom") is the second Sephira on the [[The Tree of Life]]—the first emanation from [[Kether]] that introduces differentiation into unity. If Kether is the dimensionless point, Chokmah is the **line**—pure force extending outward, the first movement, the creative impulse before it takes form.

Chokmah is the **supernal Father**, the active masculine principle that projects creative energy toward [[Binah]] (the Mother) for shaping. It is the Logos—the divine Word that speaks creation into being.

## The Supernal Father

Chokmah embodies:

- **Pure creative force** — Energy without form, potential without limitation
- **The Logos** — The Word, the vibratory impulse that initiates creation
- **Masculine principle** — The projective, active, fertilizing power
- **Wisdom as primordial knowing** — Not acquired knowledge but innate cosmic intelligence

In the [[Enochian Tradition]], Chokmah corresponds to the **2nd-3rd Aethyrs (ARN, ZOM)** approaching the unity of LIL/Kether.

- **To [[Binah]]:** Projects force for the Mother to shape into form
