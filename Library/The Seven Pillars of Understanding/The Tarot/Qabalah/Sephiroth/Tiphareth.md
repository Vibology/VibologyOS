# Tiphareth
*Beauty — The Heart of the Tree*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

**Tiphareth** (Hebrew: תפארת, "Beauty") is the sixth Sephira on the [[The Tree of Life]]—the central point where all paths converge, the heart of the Tree, the place of harmony and integration. Associated with the Sun, Tiphareth represents the **reconciliation of opposites**: mercy and severity, above and below, force and form.

Tiphareth is the Christ center, the place of the sacrificed god, the son who mediates between the divine Father/Mother above and the human kingdom below. It is beauty not as mere aesthetics but as **harmony**—the proportion that emerges when all forces are balanced.

## The Harmonizing Center

Tiphareth embodies:

- **Harmony of opposites** — The reconciliation of Chesed and Geburah
- **Solar consciousness** — Illumination, clarity, the integrated self
- **The sacrificed king** — Death and rebirth, the solar hero's journey
- **Mediation** — Bridge between the divine and the human

In the [[Heptarchia Mystica]], Tiphareth corresponds to **Carmara**, the Sun King invoked for illumination and authority.
