# Kether
*The Crown — Pure Being Before Manifestation*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

**Kether** (Hebrew: כתר, "Crown") is the first and highest Sephira on the [[The Tree of Life]]—the initial point of emanation where Ein Sof (the Infinite) first condenses into something that can be apprehended. It represents **pure being**, **divine will**, and the **source** from which all other Sephiroth flow.

Kether is essentially unknowable. It is not a thing but the **potentiality of all things**—the dimensionless point before extension, the silent breath before speech, the unity before differentiation.

## The First Emanation

Kether is sometimes called the **"Small Face"** (Zauir Anpin) in contrast to Ein Sof (the "Vast Face"). It is:

- **The first stirring** of existence within non-existence
- **The point** that contains all subsequent manifestation
- **The crown** that rests above but does not touch the head
- **The divine "I Am"** before any predicate

## Enochian Correspondence

In the [[Enochian Tradition]], the **1st Aethyr (LIL)** corresponds to Kether—the highest sphere of consciousness accessible through the 30 Aethyrs. Its governors (Occodon, Pascomb, Valgars) dwell in the realm nearest to divine unity.

## Relationship to Other Sephiroth

- **To [[Chokmah]]:** Kether emanates into Chokmah as pure force/wisdom
- **To [[Binah]]:** Through Chokmah, Kether's unity becomes form/understanding
- **To [[Malkuth]]:** Kether and Malkuth are the poles of the Tree—"Kether is in Malkuth, and Malkuth is in Kether"
