# Binah
*Understanding — The Supernal Mother*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

**Binah** (Hebrew: בינה, "Understanding") is the third Sephira on the [[The Tree of Life]]—the great Mother who receives the creative force of [[Chokmah]] and gives it form. If Chokmah is the line, Binah is the **plane**—the first container, the womb of creation, the primordial sea from which all differentiated forms emerge.

Binah is **restrictive** in the most sacred sense: she defines, limits, and shapes the unlimited force of the Father into something that can manifest. She is associated with Saturn—time, structure, the necessary limitations that make existence possible.

## The Supernal Mother

Binah embodies:

- **Form-giving power** — The capacity to shape and contain
- **The Great Sea** — Marah, the bitter waters of primordial chaos given structure
- **Feminine principle** — The receptive, formative, gestating power
- **Understanding as discrimination** — The ability to distinguish, separate, and define

In the [[Enochian Tradition]], Binah corresponds to the **7th-9th Aethyrs (DEO, ZID, ZIP)** and is associated with the Abyss threshold at [[Daath]].

## Relationship to Other Sephiroth

- **From [[Chokmah]]:** Receives pure force to shape into form
- **To [[Chesed]]:** Transmits structured energy down the Pillar of Severity via Daath
- **With Kether and Chokmah:** Forms the Supernal Triad above the Abyss
- **To [[Geburah]]:** Shares the Pillar of Severity, expressing restrictive power
