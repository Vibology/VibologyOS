# Geburah
*Severity — The Warrior's Judgment*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Geburah** (Hebrew: גבורה, "Severity" or "Strength") is the fifth Sephira on the [[The Tree of Life]]—the necessary counterbalance to [[Chesed]]'s mercy. Geburah is the Warrior, the Judge, the surgeon who cuts away what must be removed. Associated with Mars, it embodies discipline, judgment, and the destruction that serves creation.

Geburah is not evil—it is **necessary limitation**. Without severity, mercy becomes indulgence; without judgment, love becomes enabling. Geburah prunes the tree so it may bear fruit.

## The Necessary Severity

Geburah embodies:

- **Righteous judgment** — Discernment between what serves and what hinders
- **Martial discipline** — The warrior's courage and precision
- **Surgical removal** — Cutting away the diseased to preserve the healthy
- **Boundaries** — The "no" that protects the "yes"

In the [[Heptarchia Mystica]], Geburah corresponds to **Baligon**, the Mars King invoked for courage and decisive action.

## Relationship to Other Sephiroth

- **To [[Chesed]]:** Balances mercy; severity without love becomes cruelty
- **To [[Tiphareth]]:** Transmits discipline to the heart of the Tree
- **With [[Binah]]:** Shares the Pillar of Severity
