# Daath
*The Abyss — Knowledge Without Understanding*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

**Daath** (Hebrew: דעת, "Knowledge") is the hidden or "phantom" Sephira on the [[The Tree of Life]]—not counted among the ten [[Sephiroth]] yet occupying a crucial position between the Supernal Triad (Kether, Chokmah, Binah) and the lower seven Sephiroth. It represents the **Abyss**—the terrifying void that separates divine consciousness from human experience.

Daath is not a Sephira in the proper sense but a **gateway**, a **wound**, or a **veil**. It marks the place where the Tree was shattered (Shevirat HaKelim) and where the aspirant must surrender all certainty to cross into supernal awareness.

---

## Position on the Tree

- **Location:** Between Binah and Chesed, directly below the Supernal Triad
- **Path:** The "invisible" Sephira, sometimes depicted as a dotted circle
- **Polarity:** Neither masculine nor feminine—the dissolution of all polarity
- **Planet:** Traditionally attributed to Pluto or the trans-Saturnian void

---

## The Abyss

The Abyss is the great gulf fixed between the human and the divine. To cross it requires:

- **Complete ego-death** — The dissolution of all personal identity
- **Surrender of certainty** — Abandoning all conceptual frameworks
- **Confrontation with Choronzon** — The demon of dispersion who guards the crossing
- **The Oath of the Abyss** — Total dedication to the Great Work

Those who fail the crossing become "Black Brothers"—trapped in ego-inflation, wielding spiritual power without wisdom.

---

## Enochian Correspondence

In the [[Enochian Tradition]], the **10th Aethyr (ZAX)** corresponds to Daath. Aleister Crowley's scrying of ZAX remains one of the most harrowing accounts in mystical literature—an encounter with Choronzon that nearly destroyed him.

---

## Psychological Interpretation

From a Jungian perspective, Daath represents the **Dark Night of the Soul**—the confrontation with the unconscious that precedes genuine [[Individuation Process|individuation]]. It is the encounter with the [[The Self|Self]] as Void rather than as image.
