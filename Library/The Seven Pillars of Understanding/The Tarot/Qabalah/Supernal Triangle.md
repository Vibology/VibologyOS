# Supernal Triangle
*The Three Supernals — Above the Abyss*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

The **Supernal Triangle** consists of the three highest Sephiroth on the [[The Tree of Life]], existing "above the Abyss" ([[Daath]]) in a realm of pure divine unity:

| Sephirah | Name | Function |
|----------|------|----------|
| [[Kether]] | Crown | Pure unity, "I Am" |
| [[Chokmah]] | Wisdom | Supernal Father, pure force |
| [[Binah]] | Understanding | Supernal Mother, pure form |

These three Sephiroth represent the **undifferentiated Godhead** before the "fall" into manifestation. They are experienced not through the ordinary mind but through **mystical union**—the crossing of the Abyss that dissolves the ego.

---

## Above and Below the Abyss

The Abyss (associated with [[Daath]]) separates the Supernal Triangle from the seven lower Sephiroth. Crossing the Abyss represents the transition from **individual consciousness** to **cosmic consciousness**—the death of the ego and rebirth in divine awareness.

**Archangels of the Supernals:**
- [[Metatron]] — Kether
- [[Raziel]] — Chokmah
- [[Tzaphkiel]] — Binah
