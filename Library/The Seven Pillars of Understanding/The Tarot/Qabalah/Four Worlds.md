## Overview

The **Four Worlds** (Hebrew: ארבע עולמות, *Arba Olamot*) are the four planes of existence in Qabalistic cosmology, representing successive stages of divine emanation from pure spirit to dense matter:

| World | Hebrew | Translation | Element | Tarot Suit |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------|------------|
| **Atziluth** | אצילות | Emanation/Nearness | Fire | Wands |
| **Briah** | בריאה | Creation | Water | Cups |
| **Yetzirah** | יצירה | Formation | Air | Swords |
| **Assiah** | עשיה | Action/Making | Earth | Pentacles |

Each world contains its own complete [[Tree of Life]], and the Four Worlds together form a **Jacob's Ladder** of interconnected Trees, with the Malkuth of one world becoming the Kether of the next.

## The Four Worlds

### Atziluth (Archetypal World)
The world of **pure divinity**, where the Sephiroth exist as divine names and archetypes. Associated with the **Yod** of the Tetragrammaton.

### Briah (Creative World)
The world of **archangels and pure creation**, where divine archetypes become creative forces. Associated with the **Heh** of the Tetragrammaton.

### Yetzirah (Formative World)
The world of **angels and formation**, where creative forces become structured patterns. Associated with the **Vav** of the Tetragrammaton.

### Assiah (Material World)
The world of **action and matter**, where patterns become physical reality. Associated with the **final Heh** of the Tetragrammaton.
