## Overview

The **Divine Names** (Hebrew: *Shemot HaKodesh*, שמות הקודש) are the sacred appellations of God associated with each of the ten [[Sephiroth]] on the [[Tree of Life]]. Each name represents a specific **divine attribute** or **mode of divine action** in the world.

The names include the **Tetragrammaton** (YHVH), Elohim, Adonai, Shaddai, and others. Proper pronunciation and invocation of these names is central to Qabalistic ritual, meditation, and pathworking.
