## Overview

**Elohim Tzabaoth** (Hebrew: אלהים צבאות, "God of Hosts" or "God of Armies") is the **Divine Name** associated with **[[Hod]]** (Splendor), the eighth Sephirah on the Tree of Life—the sphere of Mercury, intellect, communication, and ceremonial magic.

The name combines:
- **Elohim** (אלהים) — "Gods" (plural form used for the One God), emphasizing divine multiplicity-in-unity
- **Tzabaoth** (צבאות) — "Hosts" or "Armies," referring to the celestial legions

Hod represents the **organizing intellect** that gives structure to the emotional impulses of [[Netzach]]. Elohim Tzabaoth invokes the divine power that commands the angelic hosts through **form, language, and ceremonial structure**. [[Michael]] or [[Raphael]] serve this name as Archangel of Hod.
