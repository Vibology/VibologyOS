## Overview

The **Pillar of Severity** (also called the **Black Pillar** or **Pillar of Form**) is the left pillar of the [[The Tree of Life]], consisting of three Sephiroth:

1. [[Binah]] (Understanding) — The Great Mother, form, limitation, the womb
2. [[Geburah]] (Severity) — Judgment, destruction, Mars, the warrior
3. [[Hod]] (Splendor) — Intellect, analysis, Mercury, the scribe

This pillar represents the **contracting force** in creation—limitation, form, judgment, discipline, and the necessary destruction that precedes transformation. It balances the [[Pillar of Mercy]] (expansion) through the [[Middle Pillar]] (equilibrium).
