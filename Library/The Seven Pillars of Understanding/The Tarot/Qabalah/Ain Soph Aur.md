# Ain Soph Aur
*Limitless Light — The Third Veil of Negative Existence*

## Overview

**Ain Soph Aur** (Hebrew: אין סוף אור, "Limitless Light") is the third and final of the **Three Veils of Negative Existence** that precede the emanation of [[Kether]] on the [[Tree of Life]]. The three veils are:

1. **Ain** (אין) — "Nothing" — Absolute negation, the unmanifest
2. **Ain Soph** (אין סוף) — "Without Limit" — Infinite potential
3. **Ain Soph Aur** (אין סוף אור) — "Limitless Light" — The first stirring toward manifestation

Ain Soph Aur represents the **threshold between non-existence and existence**—the moment when infinite potential begins to concentrate toward the point of Kether. It is "light" in the sense of pure awareness or pure being, not yet differentiated into subject and object.
