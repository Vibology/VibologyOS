## Overview

**YHVH Eloah va-Daath** (Hebrew: יהוה אלוה ודעת, "Lord God of Knowledge") is the **Divine Name** associated with **[[Tiphareth]]** (Beauty), the sixth Sephirah on the Tree of Life—the solar center, the seat of the Higher Self, the reconciliation of opposites.

The name combines:
- **YHVH** (יהוה) — The Tetragrammaton
- **Eloah** (אלוה) — "God" (singular form of Elohim)
- **va-Daath** (ודעת) — "and Knowledge," referring to [[Daath]], the hidden Sephirah

This divine name uniquely incorporates **Daath** (Knowledge/the Abyss), suggesting that Tiphareth is the Sephirah where the crossing of the Abyss becomes possible—where the individual soul can access divine knowledge through the Higher Self. [[Michael]] or [[Raphael]] serve this name as Archangel of Tiphareth.
