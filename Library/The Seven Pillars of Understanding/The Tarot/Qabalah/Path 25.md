# Path 25 — Samekh

## Overview

**Path 25** connects [[Yesod]] (Foundation, the Moon, the personal unconscious) to [[Tiphareth]] (Beauty, the Sun, the Higher Self). It is the **Path of Samekh** (ס), the Hebrew letter meaning "support" or "prop"—the arrow aimed at the heart.

This path is associated with [[Temperance (XIV)|Temperance]], the card of alchemical integration, the angel pouring water between vessels. It represents the journey from ego-personality (Yesod) to the solar consciousness of the Higher Self (Tiphareth)—a path of testing, purification, and balance.
