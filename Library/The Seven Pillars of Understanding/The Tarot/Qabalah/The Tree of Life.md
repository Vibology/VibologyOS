*The Qabalistic Map of Consciousness*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

The **Tree of Life** (Hebrew: עץ החיים, Etz haChayim) is the central diagram of Qabalistic philosophy—a map of consciousness depicting the **emanation of divine energy** from the infinite (Ein Sof) through ten stages (Sephiroth) to manifest creation.

The Tree consists of:
- **10 Sephiroth** (emanations/spheres)
- **22 Paths** connecting them (corresponding to the 22 Hebrew letters and 22 Major Arcana)
- **3 Pillars** organizing the structure (Severity, Mercy, Equilibrium)
- **4 Worlds** of progressive manifestation
