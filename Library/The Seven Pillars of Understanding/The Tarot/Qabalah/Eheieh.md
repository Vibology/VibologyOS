# Eheieh
*I Am — The Divine Name of Kether*

## Overview

**Eheieh** (Hebrew: אהיה, "I Am" or "I Will Be") is the **Divine Name** associated with **[[Kether]]** (Crown), the first Sephirah on the Tree of Life. This is the name God reveals to Moses at the burning bush:

> *"And God said unto Moses, 'Eheieh Asher Eheieh' — I Am That I Am."*
> — Exodus 3:14

Eheieh represents **pure being**—existence without attributes, the eternal present tense, the name that refuses definition. It is not "I am this" or "I am that," but simply **"I Am."**

In Qabalistic practice, Eheieh is vibrated when working with Kether—invoking the undifferentiated divine unity, the source from which all emanation flows. [[Metatron]], the Archangel of Kether, embodies this name.
