## Overview

**Golachab** (Hebrew: גולחב, "Burners" or "Arsonists") is the **Qlippothic order** corresponding to **[[Geburah]]** (Severity), the fifth Sephirah on the Tree of Life. Where Geburah represents righteous judgment, discipline, and the surgical removal of what is harmful, Golachab represents its **shadow distortion**: cruelty, wrath, destruction for its own sake, and the fire that consumes rather than purifies.

The Qlippoth (קליפות, "shells" or "husks") are the shadow side of the Sephiroth—the unbalanced, demonic, or pathological expressions of divine qualities. Golachab embodies **Mars without wisdom**, severity without mercy, punishment without purpose.

In psychological terms, Golachab represents the **shadow of righteous anger**: rage that has lost its connection to justice, discipline that has become cruelty, and the warrior archetype corrupted into the tyrant.
