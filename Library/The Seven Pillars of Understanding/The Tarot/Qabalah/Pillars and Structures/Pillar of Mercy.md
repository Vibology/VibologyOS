## Overview

The **Pillar of Mercy** (Hebrew: עמוד החסד, *Ammud ha-Chesed*) is the right-hand column of the [[The Tree of Life]], containing the Sephiroth that embody expansive, merciful, and masculine qualities:

| Sephirah | Name | Quality |
|----------|------|---------|
| [[Chokmah]] | Wisdom | Pure force, the supernal Father |
| [[Chesed]] | Mercy | Benevolence, abundance, Jupiter |
| [[Netzach]] | Victory | Desire, passion, Venus |

The Pillar of Mercy represents **force without form**—the expansive, creative, outpouring energy that must be balanced by the restrictive, formative energy of the Pillar of Severity (left pillar). Together, they are reconciled in the [[Middle Pillar]].

## Symbolic Associations

- **Gender:** Masculine (active, projective)
- **Color:** White (in some systems)
