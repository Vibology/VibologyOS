# The Abyss
*The Great Divide — The Chasm Between Supernal and Manifested Consciousness*

## Overview

**The Abyss** is the metaphysical chasm on the [[Tree of Life]] that separates the **Supernal Triangle** (Kether, Chokmah, Binah) from the seven lower Sephiroth. It represents the **ontological divide** between:

- The **unmanifest divine** (above) and **manifested creation** (below)
- **Pure Being** and **individuated existence**
- The **transcendent** and the **immanent**

[[Daath]] ("Knowledge") is the **non-Sephirah** that exists within the Abyss—the point of crossing, the place where the aspirant must surrender the ego to attain union with the divine. Crossing the Abyss is the **death of the personal self** and rebirth into universal consciousness.
