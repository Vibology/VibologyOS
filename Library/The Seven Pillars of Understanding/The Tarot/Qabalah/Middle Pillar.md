## Overview

The **Middle Pillar** (also called the **Pillar of Mildness** or **Pillar of Equilibrium**) is the central column of the [[Tree of Life]], containing the Sephiroth that balance Mercy and Severity:

| Sephirah | Name | Function |
|----------|------|----------|
| [[Kether]] | Crown | Pure divine unity |
| [[Daath]] | Knowledge | The Abyss crossing (hidden) |
| [[Tiphareth]] | Beauty | The Higher Self, solar center |
| [[Yesod]] | Foundation | The astral, lunar gateway |
| [[Malkuth]] | Kingdom | Physical manifestation |

The Middle Pillar represents the **direct path of ascent**—the "Path of the Arrow" that shoots straight from Malkuth to Kether, integrating the opposing forces of the [[Pillar of Mercy]] (right) and the Pillar of Severity (left).

## The Middle Pillar Exercise

In Golden Dawn practice, the **Middle Pillar Exercise** is a foundational meditation that draws divine light down through the five Middle Pillar centers, establishing equilibrium and circulating energy through the subtle body.
