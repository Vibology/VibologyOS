# Yesod
*Foundation — The Astral Gateway*

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Yesod** (Hebrew: יסוד, "Foundation") is the ninth Sephira on the [[The Tree of Life]]—the sphere of the astral plane, dreams, the unconscious, and the subtle foundation upon which physical reality rests. Associated with the Moon, Yesod represents the **receptive, reflective, fluctuating** realm between mind and matter.

Yesod is the "treasure house of images"—the repository of all psychic impressions, the realm accessed in dreams, visions, and astral projection. It is the foundation because [[Malkuth]] (physical reality) is built upon and shaped by the patterns stored in Yesod.

## The Astral Foundation

Yesod embodies:

- **The astral plane** — The realm of dreams, visions, and subtle forms
- **The unconscious** — Personal and collective psychic material
- **Sexuality and generation** — The creative force at the subtle level
- **Reflection** — The Moon as mirror of the Sun ([[Tiphareth]])

In the [[Heptarchia Mystica]], Yesod corresponds to **Hagonel**, the Moon King invoked for intuition and dreams.

## Relationship to Other Sephiroth

- **From [[Tiphareth]]:** Receives solar light, reflects it as lunar consciousness
- **From [[Netzach]] and [[Hod]]:** Receives emotional and intellectual impressions
- **To [[Malkuth]]:** Transmits the astral pattern for physical manifestation
- **On the Middle Pillar:** Bridges the abstract and the concrete
