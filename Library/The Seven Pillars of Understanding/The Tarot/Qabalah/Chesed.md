# Chesed
*Mercy — The Benevolent King*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Chesed** (Hebrew: חסד, "Mercy" or "Lovingkindness") is the fourth Sephira on the [[The Tree of Life]]—the first Sephira below the Abyss, representing the **organized, benevolent expression** of divine force in the manifest world. Chesed is the archetypal King on his throne: generous, expansive, lawgiving, and abundant.

Associated with Jupiter, Chesed embodies growth, prosperity, and the magnanimous dispensation of blessing. It is mercy without the necessary correction of [[Geburah]]—pure expansion before restriction.

Chesed embodies:
