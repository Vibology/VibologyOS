## Overview

**Adonai ha-Aretz** (Hebrew: אדני הארץ, "Lord of the Earth") is the **Divine Name** associated with **[[Malkuth]]** (Kingdom), the tenth Sephirah on the Tree of Life—the sphere of material manifestation, the physical world, the body.

The name emphasizes divine sovereignty over the material realm. *Adonai* (אדני, "Lord" or "Master") is the traditional pronunciation substitute for the Tetragrammaton (YHVH), combined with *ha-Aretz* ("the Earth") to indicate dominion over physical creation.

In Qabalistic practice, Adonai ha-Aretz is vibrated when grounding spiritual work in material reality, when consecrating physical objects, or when invoking the divine presence within the body and the world. [[Sandalphon]], the Archangel of Malkuth, serves this name.
