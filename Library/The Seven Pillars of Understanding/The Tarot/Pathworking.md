# Pathworking
*Visionary Journey Through the Tree of Life*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

**Pathworking** is a visionary meditation practice in which the practitioner imaginatively travels the paths of the Qabalistic Tree of Life, using Tarot imagery as the doorway. Each of the 22 Major Arcana corresponds to one of the 22 paths connecting the ten Sephiroth; pathworking uses these images as portals for inner exploration.

Unlike passive visualization or guided meditation, pathworking is an **active encounter**—the practitioner enters the symbolic landscape and allows autonomous experiences to unfold, similar to Jung's [[Active Imagination]] but within the structured framework of Qabalistic cosmology.

## The Practice

### Preparation
- Select a path to work (typically beginning with lower paths, ascending gradually)
- Study the corresponding Tarot card, Hebrew letter, astrological attribution
- Enter a meditative state; visualize the starting Sephirah

### Journey
- Visualize the Tarot image as a doorway or curtain
- Pass through; allow the landscape to manifest
- Encounter figures, symbols, tests appropriate to that path
- Remain receptive but alert; engage what appears

### Return
- Retrace steps consciously to the starting point
- Ground thoroughly before ending
- Record experiences immediately

### Integration
- Reflect on symbolic meanings
- Note correspondence to life circumstances
- Allow insights to inform waking behavior

## The 22 Paths

Each Major Arcanum opens a specific path:

| Path | Card | Connects | Theme |
|------|------|----------|-------|
| 11 | [[The Fool (0)]] | Kether–Chokmah | Primordial leap |
| 12 | [[The Magician (I)]] | Kether–Binah | Will and communication |
| 13 | [[The High Priestess (II)]] | Kether–Tiphareth | Hidden knowledge |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Pathworking vs. Active Imagination

| Aspect | Pathworking | Active Imagination |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Structure | Pre-established (Qabalah/Tarot) | Spontaneous (psyche's own imagery) |
| Framework | Objective symbolic system | Subjective unconscious content |
| Goal | Map territory systematically | Integrate whatever emerges |
| Tradition | Western esoteric | Jungian psychological |

Both are valid; they serve complementary functions. Pathworking provides structure; active imagination provides freedom.
