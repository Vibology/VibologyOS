# Strength (VIII)
*The Daughter of the Flaming Sword*

---
## Traditional Symbolism

When Strength appears ***upright*** in a reading, it speaks to the realm of fortitude and mastery over the animal nature. According to A.E. Waite's Pictorial Key to the Tarot, the upright meanings center on *power, energy, action, courage, magnanimity,* and *complete success*(Waite 1910).

The Golden Dawn tradition identifies Strength as the "Daughter of the Flaming Sword," representing power that is not arrested by judgment but passes on to further action(Wang 1983). This card embodies the paradox that true strength is gentle—the woman closes the lion's jaws not through force but through love.

Strength represents the higher nature subduing the animal passions. The lion is not killed or caged but *tamed*—led by a chain of flowers, the sweet yoke of Divine Law. This is mastery through relationship rather than domination, control through compassion rather than violence.

The card teaches that the greatest power is self-possession—the capacity to face one's own beast-nature (rage, lust, fear, hunger) without being consumed by it. This is Daniel in the lion's den unharmed, Samson subduing the lion, the saint with the wild animal that has become docile through spiritual presence.

When Strength appears ***reversed***, Waite gives: *despotism, abuse of power, weakness, discord,* and *disgrace*(Waite 1910).

The reversed Strength speaks to power misapplied—either through tyranny (using force where love would serve) or through weakness (unable to direct the animal energies at all). "Despotism" suggests the woman has become harsh, controlling the lion through violence rather than gentle mastery. The relationship has degraded from partnership to domination.

"Weakness" and "discord" point to the opposite failure—the inability to control instinct, the lion overwhelming the trainer. When Strength reverses, the animal drives run wild: compulsions, addictions, emotional reactivity. The higher self cannot direct the lower because it lacks the fortitude, the staying power, the courage to face the beast.

"Disgrace" indicates the shame that follows when instinct controls consciousness—when the lion eats the trainer, when the serpent energy overwhelms rather than illuminates.

The key insight is that Strength always deals with **the relationship between higher consciousness and animal nature**—upright or reversed, it governs whether beast and beauty can coexist in productive partnership.

## Esoteric Interpretation
**Teth as Serpent: The Coiled Fire**

Teth means "Serpent"—the primal life force, the Kundalini coiled at the base of the spine, the sexual-creative-spiritual energy that can destroy or illuminate depending on how it's directed. Strength as Teth represents the conscious awakening and mastery of this serpentine power.

The serpent is both the Tempter of Genesis (leading humanity to knowledge through transgression) and the Redeemer (the brazen serpent Moses raised in the desert, the symbol Christ references for his own lifting up). This dual nature encodes a central teaching: the serpent energy is neither good nor evil but *powerful*—and power requires mastery.

Teth is called the "radiant Darkness"—the fire that illuminates while remaining mysterious, the energy that empowers while demanding respect. This is the lion's roar, the serpent's strike, the solar force that burns away impurity but can also consume if not properly contained.

The woman in the card represents consciousness taming this serpent-fire, directing it upward through the chakras rather than allowing it to dissipate in lower centers. Strength is the practice of sexual sublimation, of channeling raw vitality into spiritual attainment.

**The Intelligence of Spiritual Activities**

The Sepher Yetzirah calls Path 19 the "Intelligence of all the activities of the spiritual beings." This remarkable title suggests that Strength governs not merely personal will but the entire spectrum of how spiritual forces act in the manifest world.

This path connects Chesed (Mercy, loving-kindness, expansion) to Geburah (Severity, strength, contraction). The balance of these two is the essence of Strength—not mercy alone (which becomes weak indulgence) nor severity alone (which becomes cruelty), but their synthesis: firm love, compassionate discipline, gentle power.

Spiritual beings (angels, archetypes, divine forces) act through this balanced channel. When you exercise true Strength, you are not operating from personal will alone but channeling cosmic forces that require the balance of Mercy and Severity to manifest without distortion.

**Leo: The Solar Heart**

Leo is Fixed Fire—the sustained, controlled, directed solar energy of the heart. Ruled by the Sun, Leo represents vitality, courage, generosity, the warmth that gives life. Strength is Leo at its highest octave: not the tyrant-king demanding tribute, but the noble heart that gives freely while maintaining sovereignty.

The lion is the beast of Leo—king of animals, solar symbol, the mane like sun-rays. In Egypt, the lion-headed Sekhmet was both destroyer and healer, embodying the paradox of Leo's power: it can devastate or it can protect, depending on direction.

Strength teaches that Leo's challenge is self-mastery. The lion is magnificent but can be destructive—its power must be consciously directed or it becomes rampageous. The woman taming the lion represents Leo learning to rule itself before it can rule justly.

Fixed Fire is not the sudden flash (Aries) or the spreading wildfire (Sagittarius) but the sustained flame—the hearth fire, the eternal flame in the temple, the controlled burn that cooks food and warms home without destroying structure. Strength is this domesticated solar force.

**The Paradox: Strength Through Gentleness**

Strength embodies a profound paradox: true power is gentle. The woman closes the lion's jaws not through force equal to the lion's but through a different kind of power—spiritual presence, calm authority, love that disarms violence.

This is why she leads the lion with a chain of flowers. She doesn't bind the beast with iron chains (domination through superior force) but with blossoms—the sweet yoke of Divine Law, beauty and love that make surrender feel like liberation rather than defeat.

The lion submits because it recognizes something greater than itself. This is not the submission of the conquered to the conqueror but the submission of the lower to the higher, the recognition of rightful authority. The woman has earned the lion's obedience not through violence but through demonstrated spiritual superiority.

This teaching applies internally: you cannot beat your instincts into submission through harsh discipline alone. Repression creates pressure that eventually explodes. True mastery comes through relationship with the animal nature—understanding it, honoring its needs while directing its energy toward higher purpose.

**Rider-Waite Symbolism: Beauty and the Beast**

- **The Woman**: She is not armored or weaponed but robed in white (innocentia inviolata—unviolated innocence). Her purity is not ignorance but innocence that has faced corruption and remained uncorrupted. She is calm, gentle, utterly without fear. Her courage is not the absence of fear but the presence of something greater than fear.

- **The Lion**: Magnificent beast, full-maned, powerful—yet gentle under her hands. The lion represents the lower self, the animal passions, the instinctual drives that can serve or destroy depending on whether they're mastered. He is not dead or caged but tamed, integrated, made useful.

- **The Infinity Symbol (Lemniscate)**: Above her head, the figure-eight of eternity—the same symbol worn by The Magician. This marks her as operating from spiritual consciousness, not mere personality. Her power is eternal because it comes from beyond the ego. The horizontal eight suggests infinite strength available when consciousness aligns with cosmic law.

- **The Chain of Flowers**: Around the lion's neck (barely visible, more symbolic than literal) is a garland of flowers. This represents the "sweet yoke" of Divine Law—discipline that doesn't feel like constraint because it's aligned with the soul's deepest nature. Flowers suggest beauty, pleasure, natural growth—the taming is not against the lion's nature but its fulfillment.

- **The Mountains**: In the background, abstract spiritual heights. The taming of the beast is not the goal but the means—once mastered, the lion's power can carry consciousness to heights otherwise unreachable. Beast-energy, when directed, becomes the vehicle of ascent.

- **The Yellow-Green Landscape**: The color of nature tamed into garden, wild growth organized into cultivation. This is not wilderness nor city but the productive middle ground—nature and culture in partnership.

**Balancing Chesed and Geburah: The Middle Pillar**

Path 19 is one of the three horizontal paths on the Tree of Life that connect the right pillar (mercy, expansion, masculine) to the left pillar (severity, contraction, feminine). Strength balances these forces, demonstrating that neither mercy alone nor severity alone constitutes virtue—only their synthesis does.

Too much Chesed without Geburah: weak indulgence, enabling dysfunction, love without boundaries, expansion without limit leading to dissipation.

Too much Geburah without Chesed: cruelty, harshness, discipline without compassion, contraction without limit leading to rigidity.

Strength shows the balance: firm love, compassionate discipline, boundaries held with gentleness, expansion that knows when to contract. The woman is merciful (she doesn't kill the lion) but severe (she does not allow it to run wild). This is the essence of righteous rulership.

**Cross-Tradition Parallels**

Strength appears across cultures as the master of beasts: Daniel in the lion's den (Jewish), Samson tearing the lion (Biblical), Hercules and the Nemean lion (Greek), Mithra slaying the bull (Persian), Durga riding the tiger (Hindu).

In Buddhist tradition, this is the taming of the elephant-mind—wild, powerful, potentially destructive, but when trained becomes the vehicle of enlightenment. In Taoist alchemy, it's the refinement of Jing (sexual essence) into Qi (vital energy) and Shen (spiritual energy).

The tantric traditions understand this most explicitly: Kundalini is the serpent (Teth) that must be awakened and raised through the chakras. Premature awakening without proper preparation can cause madness (the lion devouring the trainer). Strength represents the spiritual attainment necessary to direct this force safely upward.

**Personal Observations**

When this card appears for clients, it signals a time requiring courage—not physical bravery but moral fortitude, the strength to face what's difficult without flinching.

The upright Strength often appears in readings about addiction recovery, anger management, or any situation requiring mastery over compulsive behavior. The card says: you have the power to tame this beast, but not through violence against yourself. Gentleness, patience, love—these are your tools.

Strength also appears when clients need to stand firm in their convictions against external pressure. The lion here is not internal instinct but external threat—and the teaching is the same: do not meet force with force, but with calm spiritual authority that disarms aggression.

The reversed Strength frequently appears in readings about abuse of power—leaders who rule through fear, parents who discipline through cruelty, or the internal tyrant who punishes every impulse. It can also indicate the opposite: complete inability to control impulses, letting the beast run wild.

In spiritual contexts, Strength represents the stage of practice where discipline becomes devotion, where what once required effort becomes natural. The lion is no longer fighting the woman—their relationship has transformed into partnership.
