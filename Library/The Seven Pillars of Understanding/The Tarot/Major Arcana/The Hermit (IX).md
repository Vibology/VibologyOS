# The Hermit (IX)
*The Prophet of the Eternal, Magus of the Voice of Power*

---
## Traditional Symbolism

When The Hermit appears ***upright*** in a reading, it speaks to the realm of withdrawal for the sake of illumination. According to A.E. Waite's Pictorial Key to the Tarot, the upright meanings center on *prudence, circumspection,* and also (by another account) *divine inspiration*—but Waite includes the paradoxical meanings of *treason* or *roguery*(Waite 1910).

The Golden Dawn tradition identifies The Hermit as "The Prophet of the Eternal" and "Magus of the Voice of Power," representing wisdom sought and obtained from above(Wang 1983). This card embodies the archetype of voluntary isolation—the withdrawal from society not from misanthropy but from the recognition that truth cannot be found in crowds.

The Hermit stands alone on the mountaintop holding a lantern, having climbed to heights where others cannot or will not follow. His light is not for guiding others (that comes later, if at all) but for his own illumination. He seeks truth in solitude because noise obscures, because companionship often becomes codependency, because the voice of the Self can only be heard in silence.

"Prudence and circumspection" point to the Virgoan quality of discernment—the careful analysis that requires stepping back from involvement to gain perspective. "Divine inspiration" suggests that this withdrawal is not barren but fecund: in solitude, the soul opens to guidance from higher sources.

But Waite's inclusion of "treason or roguery" warns of the shadow: the one who withdraws may be avoiding responsibility, using spiritual practice as escape, claiming wisdom while evading relationship. The hermit can become the cynic, the misanthrope, the one who judges from safe distance.

When The Hermit appears ***reversed***, Waite gives: *concealment, disguise, policy,* and *unreasoned caution*(Waite 1910).

The reversed Hermit speaks to withdrawal that has become pathological—isolation as prison rather than sanctuary. "Concealment" and "disguise" suggest someone hiding, using solitude to avoid being seen rather than to see more clearly. This is not the voluntary retreat of the seeker but the fearful withdrawal of the avoider.

"Policy" (in the older sense of cunning strategy) and "unreasoned caution" point to the hermit who has become suspicious, paranoid, seeing threats where none exist. Where the upright Hermit withdraws with purpose and returns with wisdom, the reversed Hermit never returns—his light becomes a barrier rather than a beacon.

The reversed card can also indicate false humility—the spiritual teacher who claims to withdraw from the world while actually maintaining control through absence, who hoards wisdom rather than sharing it.

The key insight is that The Hermit always deals with **the paradox of solitude as preparation for service**—upright or reversed, he governs whether withdrawal leads to illumination or merely to isolation.

## Esoteric Interpretation
**Yod as Hand: The Divine Seed**

Yod is the smallest Hebrew letter, a single point—yet it is considered the foundation from which all other letters are formed. It means "Hand" (specifically the hand of God reaching into creation) and symbolizes the seed, the spermatozoon, the concentrated essence of life-power.

The Hermit as Yod represents the concentrated focal point of consciousness. He is not dispersed in many activities but gathered into singularity. This is the hand that reaches out (Yod means hand) but also the hand that grasps—understanding, comprehension, the fist that closes around truth and holds it.

As "seed," Yod represents potential in its most concentrated form—the acorn containing the oak, the sperm containing the future being. The Hermit's withdrawal is not sterile but generative: in solitude, the seed of wisdom gestates until ready to be planted in the world.

The divine hand of Yod is the first principle of will (hence the Path title "Intelligence of Will")—God's hand moving in creation, the active touch that shapes reality. The Hermit touches nothing, involved with nothing external, yet his will is potent because it's entirely focused inward.

**The Intelligence of Will: From Mercy to Beauty**

The Sepher Yetzirah calls Path 20 the "Intelligence of Will"—the force that directs divine mercy (Chesed) into manifest beauty (Tiphareth, the heart, the Solar Logos). This path represents the Will that must be refined through solitude before it can act effectively in the world.

The descent from Chesed to Tiphareth is the movement from expansive love to focused love, from abstract compassion to specific beauty. The Hermit mediates this descent by withdrawing from diffuse involvement to discover his essential nature—and that essential nature, once discovered, becomes the light that illuminates all subsequent action.

This is the Intelligence of Will because it represents will purified of egoic distortion. In solitude, without the feedback of others to shape identity, the true will emerges—what you would choose if no one were watching, what you would do if approval were irrelevant.

**Virgo: The Sacred in Service**

Virgo is Mutable Earth—the earth element in its most refined, analytical, discriminating form. Ruled by Mercury, Virgo represents the intellect turned toward practical perfection, the mind analyzing detail to discover hidden order.

The Hermit is Virgoan withdrawal—stepping back to examine, to refine, to perfect before acting. Virgo's service orientation (the Virgin as priestess) appears here as service through withdrawal: sometimes the greatest gift is absence, creating space for others to find their own light.

Virgo's association with harvest suggests The Hermit as the reaper who has gathered the crop and now separates wheat from chaff in solitude. The winnowing process requires isolation—you cannot separate essence from dross while distracted by external demands.

The Virgin aspect points to wholeness-unto-itself. The Hermit needs no one to complete him—he is sufficient, intact, virgin in the ancient sense of belonging to no one, defined by no relationship. This is not coldness but sovereignty.

**The Paradox: The Light for Others Through Light for Self**

The Hermit's central paradox: he shines the light only for himself, yet that light inevitably guides others. He does not seek followers, but followers find him. He climbs the mountain for his own reasons, but his lamp becomes a beacon to those still in the valley.

This teaching is profound: you cannot effectively serve others until you've served yourself first (in the spiritual sense—discovered your own truth, established your own center). The reversed Hermit tries to guide others while lost himself, offers light he doesn't possess, teaches truths he hasn't lived.

The upright Hermit has earned his solitude. He has tried the social path and found it insufficient. His withdrawal is not rejection of humanity but temporary separation to gain what can only be found alone—and once found, it must be brought back to serve.

**Rider-Waite Symbolism: The Peak of Solitude**

- **The Old Man**: He is the "Ancient of Days," suggesting not physical age but timeless wisdom. He has lived long enough to know that truth is not found in crowds. His grey beard and robes indicate experience, tested knowledge, the hoary wisdom of someone who has seen much and distilled it to essence.

- **The Staff**: A magic wand, a phallic symbol of Will, the rod Moses used to strike rock and bring forth water. The Hermit's staff serves multiple functions: support for the climb, tool to test ground before stepping, weapon against threats. It represents self-reliance, the capacity to walk the path without leaning on others.

- **The Lantern with Six-Pointed Star**: The lantern contains not ordinary flame but the Light of Tiphareth—the Solar Logos, the "Light of the World," Occult Science. The six-pointed star (Seal of Solomon, union of opposites, macrocosm-microcosm) indicates that this light is wisdom itself, the illumination of consciousness.

The lantern is held outward and slightly raised, not to light the path of others but to illuminate the path ahead for himself. The light doesn't emanate from him but is carried—he has found it elsewhere (above, in divine inspiration) and now bears it forward.

- **The Snow-Covered Mountain Peak**: He stands in barren landscape at altitude where nothing grows, where the air is thin, where few can follow. This represents the isolation of adepthood—the heights of consciousness where companionship becomes impossible because so few are willing to make the climb.

Snow suggests purity but also sterility—this is not the fertile valley but the austere peak. The House of the Soul is built in the desert of Daath (Knowledge, the invisible Sephirah that exists between Supernal and Manifest). This is the lonely knowing that comes from direct experience of the Abyss.

- **The Grey Robes**: He wears the "Inner and Outer Robes of Concealment" (Chokmah and Binah, Wisdom and Understanding, the Supernal Father and Mother). His grey is neither white nor black but their synthesis—neither innocent nor corrupted but experienced. Grey suggests ash, what remains after fire, the essential residue after everything burnable has burned away.

- **The Hooded Figure**: His face is partially concealed—not from dishonesty but from the recognition that the deepest truths cannot be spoken directly. The hood suggests mystery, the teaching that must be discovered rather than told.

**The Voice of Power: Prophet of the Eternal**

The Hermit is called "Magus of the Voice of Power"—suggesting that his silence contains speech, that his withdrawal is preparation for powerful utterance. The prophet withdraws to hear God's voice; then he returns to speak what he has heard.

This is why The Hermit is numbered 9—the final single digit, completion of the first cycle before the new cycle begins with 10 (Wheel of Fortune). The Hermit represents the pause, the breath between exhale and inhale, the moment of stillness that gathers energy for new expression.

When he descends the mountain (and he must descend eventually, or his wisdom becomes sterile), he speaks with the authority of one who has seen what others have not, who has climbed to where others feared to go. His voice has power because it comes from withdrawal, from silence, from the willingness to be alone with truth.

**Relationship to Other Cards**

The Hermit (Path 20, Chesed to Tiphareth) complements The Chariot (Path 18, Binah to Geburah) and Strength (Path 19, Chesed to Geburah). Where The Chariot conquers through mastery and Strength tames through love, The Hermit illuminates through withdrawal. Together they represent three modes of power: conquest, taming, wisdom.

The Hermit also mirrors The High Priestess—both are figures of withdrawal, silence, mystery. But she guards the threshold between conscious and unconscious; he has crossed it and climbed the mountain beyond. She is passive receptivity; he is active seeking.

**Cross-Tradition Parallels**

The Hermit is Diogenes seeking an honest man with his lamp, Moses on Sinai receiving the Law, Elijah in the desert fed by ravens, John the Baptist in the wilderness, the Buddha under the Bodhi tree, the Desert Fathers in Egyptian caves.

In Taoism, he is the sage who withdraws from society to live simply, who cultivates inner alchemy far from the corrupting influence of the court. In Hinduism, he is the sannyasi who renounces worldly life in old age to focus entirely on liberation.

**Personal Observations**

When this card appears for clients, it signals a time requiring withdrawal—not necessarily physical isolation but psychological separation from the noise, the opinions, the endless input that drowns out inner voice.

The upright Hermit often appears in readings about major life transitions that require solitude to process: grief, divorce, career change, spiritual crisis. The card says: stop asking others what to do. Go within. The answer is already there, but you cannot hear it while performing for an audience.

The Hermit also appears when clients need to claim their own authority—when they've been living by others' values, others' expectations, others' definitions of success. The withdrawal is not permanent but necessary: you must separate to discover who you are apart from your relationships and roles.

The reversed Hermit frequently appears for those using spiritual practice as avoidance—endless retreats, constant workshops, perpetual seeking that never finds because finding would require engagement. It can also indicate the teacher who has withdrawn into superiority, who uses wisdom as weapon rather than gift.

In spiritual contexts, The Hermit represents the stage where outer work must cease temporarily so inner work can deepen. Not all spiritual progress is visible, measurable, sharable. Some of the most important work happens alone, in silence, where no one can witness or validate.
