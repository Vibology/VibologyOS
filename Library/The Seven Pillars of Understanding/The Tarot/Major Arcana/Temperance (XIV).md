# Temperance (XIV)
*The Daughter of the Reconcilers / The Bringer Forth of Life*

---

## Traditional Symbolism

According to Waite's *Pictorial Key to the Tarot*, Temperance signifies *economy, moderation, frugality, management, and accommodation*. This is not bland equilibrium but **alchemical precision**—the careful measurement and blending of opposing forces to create something that transcends both.

The Golden Dawn titles this card "The Daughter of the Reconcilers" and "The Bringer Forth of Life." Temperance is the offspring of the cosmic forces that unite opposites (the Reconcilers). She is the principle of **combination**—not the destruction of polarity but its integration. She brings forth life by *mixing* rather than choosing.

The Golden Dawn tradition also describes Temperance as representing a "Dark Night of the Soul"—a deep tunnel entered in the belief that light awaits at the end(Wang 1983). This is the testing period, the trial by patience, the waiting while the alchemical work unfolds. Temperance is the realization of material effects through the combination of spiritual forces—**grounding the high into the low**.

In divinatory practice, Temperance appears when **integration is required**. She signals that opposites must be blended, not chosen between. She declares: *Neither extreme. The third way.* When the querent is torn between passion and reason, action and stillness, spirit and matter, Temperance offers the possibility of *synthesis*—holding both until something new emerges.

**Context shapes meaning**: In spiritual questions, Temperance indicates the necessity of balancing disciplines (meditation and action, solitude and community). In material questions, it signals careful management, strategic patience, the slow work of building rather than the dramatic leap.

**Reversed**, Waite identifies Temperance with *"things connected with churches, religions, sects, the priesthood"*—suggesting that the reversed card points to institutional religion, dogma, external authority rather than inner alchemy. The reversed Temperance is over-moderation (bland equilibrium, loss of fire), spiritual bypassing (using "balance" to avoid commitment), or perfectionism (endless refinement without release).

The core teaching: **Transformation is not violence but precision**. Temperance does not destroy fire or water. She combines them—and in that combination, creates steam.

## Divination Use
**Upright**: Combination of forces, alchemy, balance, moderation. The blending of opposites within the physical vessel. Management, economy, frugality. Patience, self-control, strategic waiting. The creation of a "third force" that transcends both extremes. The tempering process—neither too hot nor too cold, but the precise temperature required for transformation.

*Keywords*: Balance, moderation, patience, alchemy, synthesis, the middle way, integration, tempering, combination.

**Reversed**: Institutional religion, dogma, external authority. Over-moderation (loss of vitality, bland equilibrium). Spiritual bypassing (using "balance" to avoid necessary extremes or commitments). Perfectionism (endless refinement, inability to complete the work). Imbalance disguised as balance. Lack of patience or self-control. Failure to integrate opposites.

## Esoteric Interpretation
### Hebrew Letter: Samekh (ס) – The Prop That Sustains

**Samekh** means "prop" or "support"—the framework, the scaffolding, the structure that holds something in place during the ordeal. With a gematria value of **60**, Samekh resonates with the number of completion through cycles (60 seconds, 60 minutes—the return to beginning after traversing the circle).

Samekh is described in esoteric literature as the **"Womb preserving Life"**—the container that protects the developing embryo, the crucible that holds the alchemical mixture while transformation occurs. Samekh is **patience**: the willingness to *wait* while the work unfolds, the capacity to sustain tension without premature resolution.

The letter's circular form (ס) is significant: it is a closed loop, a boundary, an enclosure. Samekh is the circle that **contains** the volatile energies, preventing them from dissipating before the transformation is complete. This is the alchemical vessel, the *vas hermeticum*, the sealed chamber in which fire and water can intermingle without destroying each other.

Samekh also supports the **Astral Current**—the fluctuating sexual and electromagnetic energies of the "Astral Light" or "Akashic Fluid" that underlie and activate the material plane. The Astral Current is the life force, the chi, the prana—the invisible energy that animates matter. Samekh is the structure that stabilizes this current, preventing it from overwhelming the physical body while allowing it to flow through.

### Sepher Yetzirah: The Intelligence of Probation

Path 25 is titled the **"Intelligence of Probation"** (also translated as "Intelligence of Tentative" or "Temptation Intelligence") in the *Sepher Yetzirah*, because it is the "primary temptation by which the Creator tries the righteous."

This is a profound and paradoxical title. Temperance is the **test**—the trial by patience, the ordeal of waiting. The "probation" is not punishment but *measurement*: Can the physical body handle the influx of Light from the Higher Self without undergoing pathological dissociation? Can the personality integrate the spiritual energies without fragmenting?

The path ascends from **Yesod (Foundation, the Moon, the etheric body)** to **Tiphareth (Beauty, the Sun, the Higher Self)**. This is the journey from the realm of dreams, images, and illusions (Yesod) to the solar Heart of truth and beauty (Tiphareth). It is the ascent of consciousness from the subconscious to the superconscious—but this ascent *cannot be rushed*.

Temperance is the "Dark Night" that precedes adepthood. It is the period when the aspirant has glimpsed the light of Tiphareth but has not yet stabilized that vision. The temptation is to *force* the process, to leap prematurely, to claim attainment before integration. The test is whether the aspirant can **wait**, can **moderate**, can **temper** the fire of spiritual ambition with the water of patience.

The frustration of lack of progress is itself a major test. Temperance asks: *Can you continue the work even when nothing seems to be happening?* This is the alchemical *coction*—the slow heating, the patient simmering, the refusal to turn up the flame too high.

### Astrological Attribution: Sagittarius – Mutable Fire

Temperance is attributed to **[[Sagittarius ♐]]**, the sign of Mutable Fire. Sagittarius is the centaur-archer, half-animal and half-human, aiming an arrow at a distant target. This is the principle of **synthesis**—the integration of instinct and intellect, body and spirit, earthly and celestial.

Sagittarius is ruled by **Jupiter**, the planet of expansion, philosophy, optimism, and higher learning. Jupiter seeks meaning, quests for truth, synthesizes disparate knowledge into coherent wisdom. Temperance embodies Jupiter's expansive yet disciplined energy: not the reckless leap but the *aimed shot*.

Sagittarius is **Mutable Fire**—fire that adapts, that can be modulated, that does not burn wildly but can be *controlled* without being extinguished. This is the fire of the forge, the alchemical furnace, the hearth—fire in service of transformation rather than destruction.

The Sagittarian arrow is also significant: it must be drawn back before it is released. Temperance is the drawing back, the holding of tension, the patience required before the arrow flies. The arrow aimed at the sun (Tiphareth) must be released at the right moment, with the right force—neither too weak nor too strong.

### The Rider-Waite Symbolism: A Symbol-by-Symbol Analysis

The Rider-Waite depiction of Temperance is rich with alchemical and Kabbalistic symbolism:

- **The Androgynous Angel**: Temperance is depicted as an **androgynous figure**—neither male nor female, or both simultaneously. This is the *hermaphrodite*, the *rebis* of alchemy, the union of opposites within a single being. The androgyny signifies the **higher human triplicity**: the integration of masculine and feminine, solar and lunar, active and receptive. Temperance is the alchemical marriage made manifest in form.

- **The Wings of Flame**: The angel's **wings are of flame**, representing the "Spirit of the Mighty Waters." This paradoxical image—wings of fire associated with water—encapsulates the alchemical mystery: fire and water do not destroy each other but **interpenetrate**. The fiery wings suggest that even the "cooling" function of Temperance is animated by divine fire. The wings are also reminiscent of the Seraphim, the highest order of angels, beings of pure flame who surround the throne of God.

- **The White Robe**: The angel wears a **white robe**, signifying purity, the albedo (whitening) stage of alchemy, and the clarified consciousness that follows the nigredo of Death. White is the color of integration, of synthesis, of the union of all colors.

- **The Golden Square and Triangle on the Breast**: On the angel's breast is a **golden square** with a **triangle** inscribed within or overlaying it. This is one of the most esoteric symbols in the card:
  - The **square** represents **matter, the number 4, the four elements, and Chesed** (the fourth Sephirah, Mercy). The square is manifestation, the material plane, the physical body.
  - The **triangle** represents **the Supernals** (Kether, Chokmah, Binah—the first three Sephiroth), the governing principles of the manifest universe. The triangle is spirit, the divine triad, the higher consciousness.
  - Together, they form the **"square and triangle of the septenary"**—a reference to the number **7** (3 + 4 = 7). Seven is the number of completion, the seven days of creation, the seven planets, the seven chakras. Temperance is the integration of spirit (triangle) and matter (square) to create the perfected human (7).

- **The Solar Disk on the Forehead**: A **sun sign** appears on the angel's forehead—the mark of **Tiphareth**, the solar consciousness, the Higher Self. This indicates that Temperance is not a human figure but an emanation of the solar intelligence. The forehead placement suggests the third eye, the seat of vision and higher perception.

- **The Two Vessels and the Flowing Water**: Temperance holds two **chalices** or vessels, one in each hand, and pours liquid between them. The water flows **upward** from the lower vessel to the higher—a violation of natural law, signifying that this is **alchemical water**, not ordinary H₂O. This is the "essences of life," the subtle energies that can be manipulated by consciousness.

  The pouring between vessels represents the **rhythmic circulation of sexual and spiritual energy** (the Astral Current). This is the *circulation of the light*, the Microcosmic Orbit in Taoist alchemy, the rising of kundalini in Hindu tantra. The water flows from vessel to vessel without spilling—perfect control, perfect moderation.

  The vessels themselves are the **vessels of the body**: the lower vessel is the sacral chakra (sexual energy, creativity, emotion); the upper vessel is the heart or throat chakra (love, expression, higher emotion). Temperance circulates energy between these centers, refining base impulse into elevated expression.

- **One Foot on Land, One in Water**: Temperance stands with **one foot on solid ground** and the **other foot in water**. This is the posture of the **liminal being**—operating in the threshold between worlds. The land represents the conscious mind, waking reality, the material plane. The water represents the unconscious, the dream realm, the astral plane (Yesod). Temperance bridges both—she is not "of the world" or "of the spirit" but *of both simultaneously*.

- **The Yellow Flowers in the Landscape**: In the background, **yellow flowers** bloom. Waite notes that "conventional emblems are renounced herein," suggesting that these are not traditional iris (as in some older decks) but simply natural flora. The yellow color, however, is significant—yellow is the color of **intellect, clarity, illumination**. The flowers suggest that the alchemical work of Temperance produces a flowering of consciousness.

- **The Path Leading to the Mountain**: A **winding path** leads from the foreground into the distance, ascending toward **mountains on the horizon**. This is the spiritual path, the way of ascent, the journey from Yesod to Tiphareth. The path is not straight—it winds, requiring patience and flexibility. The mountains represent the heights of spiritual attainment, the peaks that must be climbed.

- **The Crown of Light Above the Horizon**: Above the mountains, in the "great light" on the horizon, a **crown** is faintly visible (or a radiant sun). This is the crown of **Kether**, the ultimate goal of the ascent, the union with the divine source. Temperance walks the path toward the crown, but she has not yet arrived—she is *in process*.

### Core Paradoxes and Mysteries

Temperance embodies these paradoxes:

1. **Moderation requires intensity**: To balance extremes requires tremendous focus and control. Temperance is not passive—she is fiercely disciplined.
2. **Fire and water coexist**: In alchemy, opposites do not cancel each other but create a third force. Temperance demonstrates that contradiction is the engine of creation.
3. **The test is patience**: In a world that values speed, Temperance teaches that the highest attainment requires *waiting*. The frustration is the test.
4. **Progress occurs invisibly**: During the alchemical *coction*, nothing seems to happen—but everything is transforming beneath the surface.
5. **The path ascends by descending**: To reach Tiphareth (the heart), one must first stabilize Yesod (the foundation). The spiritual journey requires grounding, not flight.

Temperance is the card of **strategic surrender**: surrendering to the timing of the process, surrendering to the necessity of moderation, surrendering the ego's demand for immediate results.

### Alchemical Correspondence: Solve et Coagula

In alchemy, Temperance corresponds to the process of **Solve et Coagula**—"dissolve and coagulate," "separate and reunite." This is the fundamental rhythm of the alchemical work:

1. **Solve (Dissolve)**: Break down the prima materia into its constituent elements. Separate the volatile from the fixed, the subtle from the gross. This is analysis, differentiation, the recognition of polarity.

2. **Coagula (Coagulate)**: Reunite the elements in a new configuration. Synthesize, integrate, create a compound that is more than the sum of its parts. This is the creation of the Philosopher's Stone.

Temperance is the agent of this process. She is the alchemist who knows how to dissolve without destroying, how to coagulate without rigidifying. She works with **fire** (the solvent, the force that breaks down) and **water** (the menstruum, the medium in which transformation occurs). She tempers fire with water and animates water with fire, creating **steam**—a third substance that partakes of both elements but is neither.

The alchemical vessel (the *vas hermeticum*) is the body itself. Temperance performs the Great Work *within the cauldron of the physical form*. This is embodied spirituality: the recognition that transformation occurs not by escaping the body but by transmuting it.

### Cross-Tradition Parallels

- **Artemis (Diana)**: The Greek goddess of the hunt, the moon, and wilderness. Artemis is the virgin huntress, the maiden of the silver bow, who moves between the wild and the civilized. Temperance echoes Artemis in her precision, her independence, her mastery of opposing realms.

- **Archangel Michael**: In esoteric Christianity, Michael is the angel of balance, judgment, and protection. He is often depicted with a sword and scales, weighing souls, discerning truth from falsehood. Michael is the warrior of temperance—fierce but just, powerful but measured.

- **The Taoist Alchemist**: In Taoist alchemy, the practitioner circulates chi between the *dan tian* (energy centers), refining gross energy into subtle energy, and subtle energy into spirit. This is the Microcosmic Orbit, the internal alchemy that Temperance embodies.

- **The Hindu Kundalini**: In tantra, kundalini energy rises from the base of the spine (muladhara) to the crown (sahasrara), passing through and activating the chakras. This requires precise balance—too much energy, and the system burns out; too little, and the energy stagnates. Temperance is the practitioner who modulates the kundalini flow.

- **The Centaur**: Sagittarius is the centaur—half-horse (instinct, animal nature) and half-human (reason, consciousness). Temperance is the integration of these halves, the recognition that spirit does not transcend the body but *includes* it.

### Relationship to Adjacent Cards

- **Preceded by [[Death (XIII)]]**: Death is the dissolution (*nigredo*, putrefaction). Temperance is the recombination that follows. Death breaks down; Temperance rebuilds. Death is the descent into the underworld; Temperance is the ascent with the treasure.

- **Followed by [[The Devil (XV)]]**: Temperance is the balanced use of energy; The Devil is energy that has become unbalanced, compulsive, enslaving. Temperance is self-control; The Devil is the shadow side of desire. Temperance succeeds when the opposites are integrated; The Devil appears when one pole dominates.

- **Mirrored by [[The High Priestess (II)]]**: Both figures are liminal, standing between worlds. But The High Priestess is passive, veiled, receptive. Temperance is active, visible, working. The High Priestess guards the threshold; Temperance *uses* the threshold as her workshop.

### Psychological and Jungian Depth

In Jungian terms, Temperance represents the **Transcendent Function**—the psychic process that emerges when opposites are held in tension without premature resolution. When the ego is torn between two conflicting impulses (conscious vs. unconscious, persona vs. shadow, anima vs. animus), the temptation is to choose one and repress the other. But the Transcendent Function appears when both are held, when the tension is *sustained*.

Out of this sustained tension, a **third force** emerges—a symbol, a dream, a new possibility that was not available to either pole. This is the birth of the Self, the integration of opposites within a larger wholeness.

**Shadow Expressions**:

- **Over-moderation**: The fear of extremes leading to bland equilibrium. The shadow Temperance loses vitality, becomes gray, refuses all passion.
- **Spiritual bypassing**: Using "balance" as an excuse to avoid necessary commitments or confrontations. "I'm being moderate" becomes a defense against engagement.
- **Perfectionism**: Endless refinement without release. The alchemist who never completes the Great Work because it's "not ready yet."
- **Imbalance disguised as balance**: The person who claims to be "moderate" but is actually avoiding one pole entirely.

The gift of integration: **Learning when to act and when to wait**. Temperance does not abolish extremes—she teaches the *rhythm* between them. She is not permanent stasis but *dynamic equilibrium*: the ability to move between poles without being captured by either.
