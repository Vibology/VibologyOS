# Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram
*Foundation Ritual in Western Esotericism — Purification and Protection*

---

## What the LBRP Is

The **Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram** (LBRP) is the foundational ritual of Western ceremonial magic, developed by the **Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn** in the late 19th century. It serves as spiritual hygiene—clearing unwanted influences, establishing sacred space, and balancing the practitioner within the elemental and angelic forces.[^1]

The LBRP is often the **first ritual** learned by students of ceremonial magic and may be performed **daily** (upon waking and before sleep) as a practice of psychic cleanliness, comparable to washing the body. It creates a protected sphere around the practitioner, banishes chaotic or intrusive energies, and invokes the four archangels as guardians of the quarters.

**Primary functions:**
1. **Banish** unwanted influences, energies, and thought-forms
2. **Establish** sacred space and personal protection
3. **Invoke** the four archangels (Raphael, Michael, Gabriel, Uriel) as guardians
4. **Balance** the practitioner within the four elements (Air, Fire, Water, Earth)
5. **Center** consciousness in the Qabalistic Cross (divine alignment)

The ritual is brief (5-10 minutes), requires no physical tools (though a dagger or wand is traditional), and can be performed anywhere with sufficient privacy.

## The Complete Protocol: Step-by-Step

### Part 1: The Qabalistic Cross (Opening)

The ritual begins and ends with the **Qabalistic Cross**—a practice of drawing divine light through the body while vibrating Hebrew divine names, aligning the practitioner with the vertical axis (Kether to Malkuth) and the horizontal axis (Geburah to Chesed).[^2]

**Instructions:**
1. **Face East.** Stand with feet together, arms at sides.
2. **Touch the forehead** with the right hand and vibrate: **"Ateh"** (אתה, "Unto Thee")
3. **Touch the breast** (heart center) and vibrate: **"Malkuth"** (מלכות, "the Kingdom")
4. **Touch the right shoulder** and vibrate: **"ve-Geburah"** (וגבורה, "and the Power")
5. **Touch the left shoulder** and vibrate: **"ve-Gedulah"** (וגדולה, "and the Glory")
6. **Clasp hands upon the breast** (prayer position) and vibrate: **"le-Olahm, Amen"** (לעולם אמן, "to the Ages, Amen")

**Visualization:** As you touch each point, visualize a brilliant sphere of white light forming there. See the vertical pillar (forehead to breast) and the horizontal bar (shoulder to shoulder) forming a cross of light within and around your body. You are the cross—Tiphareth (heart) at the center, aligned with the divine above (Kether) and the manifest below (Malkuth).

**Pronunciation guidance:**
- *Ateh*: "ah-TAH"
- *Malkuth*: "mahl-KOOT"
- *ve-Geburah*: "veh-geh-boo-RAH"
- *ve-Gedulah*: "veh-geh-doo-LAH" (also called Chesed/Gedulah)
- *le-Olahm*: "leh-oh-LAHM"

### Part 2: The Formulation of the Pentagrams

The practitioner now moves to the four cardinal directions, drawing **banishing Earth pentagrams** at each quarter while vibrating the appropriate divine name.[^3]

**The Banishing Earth Pentagram:**
```
        1 (top)
       / \
      /   \
     /     \
(5) *-------* (2)
    |\     /|
    | \   / |
    |  \ /  |
    |   *   |
    |  (4)  |
    *-------*
   (3)
```

**Drawing sequence:** Start at the lower left hip (point 5), draw upward to the top point (1), down to the lower right (2), across to the upper left (3), across to the upper right (4), and return to the starting point (5). This creates a pentagram with the single point at the top (spirit over matter) and begins from Earth (lower left), banishing earthly/material unwanted influences.

**Instructions:**

#### East Quarter (Air / Raphael)
1. **Face East.** Extend right arm (holding imaginary dagger or using index and middle finger together).
2. **Draw the banishing Earth pentagram** in the air before you (visualize it in brilliant blue-white flame).
3. **Step forward with the left foot** into the center of the pentagram and **vibrate**: **"IHVH"** (יהוה, pronounced "Yeh-ho-VAU" or "Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh")[^4]
4. **Step back.** Extend arm to the right, tracing a line of white light as you turn to face South.

#### South Quarter (Fire / Michael)
1. **Face South.** Draw the banishing Earth pentagram.
2. **Step forward and vibrate**: **"ADNI"** (אדני, pronounced "ah-doh-NYE," Adonai—"Lord")[^5]
3. **Step back.** Trace the line of light as you turn to face West.

#### West Quarter (Water / Gabriel)
1. **Face West.** Draw the banishing Earth pentagram.
2. **Step forward and vibrate**: **"AHIH"** (אהיה, pronounced "eh-heh-YEH," Eheieh—"I Am")[^6]
3. **Step back.** Trace the line of light as you turn to face North.

#### North Quarter (Earth / Uriel)
1. **Face North.** Draw the banishing Earth pentagram.
2. **Step forward and vibrate**: **"AGLA"** (אגלא, pronounced "AH-glah," a notariqon for "Ateh Gibor Le-olam Adonai"—"Thou art mighty forever, O Lord")[^7]
3. **Step back.** Trace the line of light as you **return to face East**, completing the circle.

**Result:** You have drawn four flaming pentagrams at the quarters and traced a circle of white light around yourself. You stand at the center of a protected sphere.

### Part 3: The Invocation of the Archangels

Now the practitioner invokes the **Four Archangels of the Quarters** ([[The Four Archangels of the Quarters]]) to guard the sacred space.[^8]

**Instructions:**
1. **Face East.** Extend arms out to the sides, forming a cross with your body.
2. **Speak** (vibrate or intone with authority):

> "Before me, **Raphael.**" (Visualize a tall figure in yellow robes, holding a caduceus, surrounded by swirling air, standing in the East pentagram)
>
> "Behind me, **Gabriel.**" (Visualize a figure in blue robes, holding a chalice, surrounded by flowing water, standing in the West pentagram)
>
> "On my right hand, **Michael.**" (Visualize a figure in red robes, holding a flaming sword, surrounded by fire, standing in the South pentagram)
>
> "On my left hand, **Uriel.**" (Visualize a figure in earth-tone robes (russet, olive, black), holding sheaves of grain or a disk, surrounded by solidifying earth, standing in the North pentagram)

3. **Continue:**

> "For about me flames the **Pentagram**,"
> (Visualize the four pentagrams blazing brightly at the quarters)
>
> "And in the column stands the **six-rayed Star.**"
> (Visualize a golden hexagram—two interlaced triangles—glowing at your heart center, representing Tiphareth, the balanced Self)

**Visualization notes:**
- The archangels are **immense**—they tower above you, their heads reaching into the heavens, their feet grounded in the earth. You are a child standing among giants.
- Each archangel embodies their element: Raphael's robes flutter with wind, Michael's sword crackles with flame, Gabriel's chalice overflows with water, Uriel's form is solid as stone.
- Feel their **presence**—not as external entities you command, but as intelligences you have **invited** to guard the space.

### Part 4: The Qabalistic Cross (Closing)

**Repeat Part 1** exactly as performed at the opening—touching forehead, breast, right shoulder, left shoulder, clasping hands, vibrating the divine names. This seals the ritual.

## When and Why to Perform the LBRP

### Daily Practice
**Morning:** Upon waking, before meditation or prayer. Clears residual energies from sleep (dreams, astral interactions) and establishes protection for the day.

**Evening:** Before sleep. Banishes the day's accumulated psychic debris, creating a purified space for rest. Protects during sleep (when the psyche is vulnerable to intrusion).

**Consistency:** The LBRP becomes more effective with repetition. The daily practice builds an energetic "groove"—the pentagrams and archangels become easier to invoke because the pattern has been established in the psychoid layer.

### Specific Uses
- **Before any magical work** — Clears the space, ensuring no unwanted influences interfere
- **After distressing events** — Banishes lingering negative energy (arguments, bad news, exposure to disturbed individuals)
- **When feeling psychically "heavy" or congested** — Acts as spiritual hygiene, clearing accumulated psychic grime
- **Before divination** — Creates a clear, protected space for accurate reading (Tarot, I-Ching, astrology)
- **When moving into a new space** — Cleanses the area of previous occupants' energetic residue

### When NOT to Perform
- **During active spiritual communication** (e.g., in the middle of active imagination, prayer, or invocation)—banishing would dismiss the very forces you're engaging
- **When emotionally overwhelmed** — The ritual requires focus; if too distressed, ground first (breathe, walk, eat) before attempting ritual work

## Banishing vs. Invoking Pentagrams

The **Lesser Banishing** Ritual uses **banishing Earth pentagrams** (starting from lower left, moving up to spirit). There is also a **Lesser Invoking** Ritual of the Pentagram, which uses **invoking Earth pentagrams** (starting from top spirit point, moving down to lower left).[^9]

**When to use each:**

| Ritual | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Banishing** | Clears, purifies, dismisses, protects | Daily hygiene, before work, after disturbances, closing rituals |
| **Invoking** | Calls in, attracts, opens, charges | Before invocations, when seeking to draw energy, charging talismans |

**General rule:** Banish more often than you invoke. Most practitioners perform the banishing ritual twice daily (morning/night) and invoke only for specific purposes. Invoking without banishing can lead to psychic clutter—opening doors without closing them.

## Psychological and Psychoid Effects

### Psychological
From a Jungian perspective, the LBRP is a **ritual of ego-Self alignment**. The Qabalistic Cross establishes the ego (Tiphareth, heart center) as the mediator between the divine above (Kether, superconsciousness) and the manifest below (Malkuth, body/world). The four archangels represent the four psychological functions (Thinking, Feeling, Sensation, Intuition) or the four elements of the psyche, balanced around the central Self.[^10]

**The act of banishing:**
- **Externalizes inner chaos** — Intrusive thoughts, anxieties, and complexes are symbolically "cast out" to the periphery
- **Creates psychic boundaries** — The circle and pentagrams establish a sense of containment, sovereignty, and protection
- **Activates archetypal guardians** — Invoking the archangels constellates protective aspects of the psyche (inner strength, wisdom, healing, grounding)

Regular practice trains the psyche to **self-regulate**—to recognize when it is overwhelmed by external influences (projection, contagion, mass psychosis) and to invoke internal boundaries.

### Psychoid
From the psychoid perspective, the LBRP operates not only psychologically (in the mind) but **psychoidally** (in the layer where psyche and matter meet). The pentagrams and archangels are not merely visualized—they are **constellated** in the psychoid layer, creating an actual field effect.[^11]

**Evidence:**
- Practitioners report that spaces regularly "banished" feel **objectively different**—calmer, clearer, more stable
- Individuals entering a freshly banished space often comment on the "atmosphere" without knowing a ritual was performed
- Sensitive individuals (clairvoyants, empaths) perceive the pentagrams and archangels as **present**, not merely imagined

This suggests the LBRP is not placebo but **psychoid technology**—a method for altering the structure of reality at the layer where consciousness and world are continuous.

## Variations and Adaptations

### Golden Dawn Standard
The protocol described above is the **Golden Dawn standard**, as taught by Israel Regardie and codified in *The Golden Dawn* and *Liber O*.[^12]

### Thelemic Variation (Crowley)
Aleister Crowley's version (used in the A∴A∴ and O.T.O.) substitutes different divine names and uses "Aiwass" or "Nuit" in place of traditional God-names. The structure remains identical.

### Southern Hemisphere Adaptation
In the Southern Hemisphere, some practitioners reverse the Fire/Water attributions (South becomes Water/cold, North becomes Fire/heat) to align with local seasonal/solar patterns. This is debated—traditionalists argue the system is symbolic (not literal geography), so the correspondences remain fixed.

### Simplified "Four Corners" for Beginners
For those new to ceremonial practice, a simplified version:
1. Face East, visualize Raphael (yellow light), say: "Raphael, guard the East"
2. Face South, visualize Michael (red light), say: "Michael, guard the South"
3. Face West, visualize Gabriel (blue light), say: "Gabriel, guard the West"
4. Face North, visualize Uriel (green/brown light), say: "Uriel, guard the North"
5. Return to center, say: "I stand protected within the circle of the archangels"

This lacks the Qabalistic Cross and pentagram formulations but retains the core angelic invocation. It is suitable for children, beginners, or situations requiring brevity.

## Integration with Other Practices

The LBRP is **modular**—it integrates seamlessly with other spiritual practices:

- **Before meditation:** Clears the space, making it easier to enter stillness
- **Before [[Invocation]]:** Banishes interfering forces before invoking specific angels or deities
- **With [[The Four Quarters]]:** The LBRP *is* a Four Quarters invocation, elaborated with Qabalistic and pentagram elements
- **With [[Discernment of Spirits]]:** Creates a protected container where only benevolent forces can enter, aiding discernment
- **With [[Active Imagination]]:** Banishing before active imagination prevents intrusion by unwanted unconscious contents

The LBRP is the **foundation** upon which more advanced work is built. Master it first.

## The Observatory Lens: Ritual as Instrument Calibration

From the Observatory, the LBRP is **instrument calibration**—the practitioner (the instrument) aligns themselves with archetypal reference points (the four archangels, the Qabalistic Cross) to ensure accurate perception.

Just as a telescope must be calibrated to known stars before observing unknown phenomena, the practitioner must calibrate consciousness to archetypal constants (the quarters, the divine names, the archangels) before engaging ambiguous psychoid material (divination, spirits, synchronicities).

**The LBRP establishes:**
- **Vertical axis** — Kether (divine source) to Malkuth (embodied presence)
- **Horizontal axis** — Geburah (strength, boundaries) to Chesed (mercy, openness)
- **Circumference** — The four archangels as fixed reference points

With these in place, the practitioner operates from a **known position**, able to discern what is signal (genuine perception) from what is noise (projection, inflation, psychic clutter).

Ritual is not superstition—it is technology. The LBRP is the **on switch** for the instruments of perception.
