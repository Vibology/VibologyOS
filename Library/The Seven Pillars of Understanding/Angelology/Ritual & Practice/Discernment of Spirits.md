## Overview

**Discernment of Spirits** (*diakrisis pneumaton*, διάκρισις πνευμάτων) is the Christian mystical practice of **distinguishing between spiritual influences**—determining whether a vision, voice, impulse, or experience originates from:

1. **Divine/Angelic source** (God, Christ, Holy Spirit, angels)
2. **Human source** (ego, imagination, wishful thinking)
3. **Demonic source** (deception, temptation, illusion)

Criteria for discernment (from Ignatius of Loyola):
- **Consolation** (peace, clarity, love, humility) → likely divine
- **Desolation** (fear, confusion, pride, division) → likely demonic
- **Fruits** (does it lead to virtue, service, love?) → test by results

The gift of discernment is essential for navigating mystical experiences, spiritual direction, and protection from spiritual deception.
