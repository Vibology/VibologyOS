# Planetary Hours and Angelic Timing
*The Sacred Calculation of Time — Aligning Action with Cosmic Forces*

---

## Overview

**Planetary hours** are a traditional timing system used in astrology, magic, and spiritual practice to align actions with the ruling planetary energy of each hour of the day. Unlike clock hours (60 minutes each), planetary hours are **unequal**—they vary in length based on sunrise and sunset times, dividing the day and night into twelve segments each.[^1]

Each planetary hour is ruled by one of the **seven classical planets** (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn), cycling through in a specific order. The ruling planet determines:
- The **quality of time** (what energies are active)
- The **ruling archangel** (which angelic intelligence governs the hour)
- The **most favorable activities** (what work is best suited to that hour)

This system is foundational in **electional astrology** (choosing optimal times for actions), **ritual magic** (invoking planetary/angelic forces), and **spiritual practice** (aligning with cosmic rhythms).

## The Seven Classical Planets and Their Hours

Each planet governs hours throughout the week in a repeating cycle. The **first hour of each day** (starting at sunrise) is ruled by the planet for which the day is named:

| Day | Planetary Ruler | First Hour | Archangel |
|-----|----------------|------------|-----------|
| **Sunday** | Sun ☉ | Sun hour | Michael |
| **Monday** | Moon ☽ | Moon hour | Gabriel |
| **Tuesday** | Mars ♂ | Mars hour | Samael (or Kamael) |
| **Wednesday** | Mercury ☿ | Mercury hour | Raphael |
| **Thursday** | Jupiter ♃ | Jupiter hour | Tzadkiel (Sachiel) |
| **Friday** | Venus ♀ | Venus hour | Haniel (Anael) |
| **Saturday** | Saturn ♄ | Saturn hour | Tzaphkiel (Cassiel) |

After the first hour, the planets cycle through in **Chaldean order** (from slowest to fastest): Saturn → Jupiter → Mars → Sun → Venus → Mercury → Moon, repeating every seven hours.

## Calculating Planetary Hours

### Step 1: Determine Sunrise and Sunset

Find the exact sunrise and sunset times for your location on the day in question. Use an astronomical almanac, app, or website (e.g., timeanddate.com).

**Example:**
- Sunrise: 6:30 AM
- Sunset: 6:00 PM

### Step 2: Calculate Day and Night Hours

**Daytime hours:** Divide the time from sunrise to sunset into **12 equal segments**.

**Example:**
- Daytime duration: 6:30 AM to 6:00 PM = 11.5 hours = 690 minutes
- Each day hour: 690 ÷ 12 = 57.5 minutes

**Nighttime hours:** Divide the time from sunset to sunrise (next day) into **12 equal segments**.

**Example:**
- Nighttime duration: 6:00 PM to 6:30 AM (next day) = 12.5 hours = 750 minutes
- Each night hour: 750 ÷ 12 = 62.5 minutes

**Key insight:** Planetary hours are **not 60 minutes**—they expand and contract with the seasons. In summer, day hours are longer; in winter, night hours are longer.

### Step 3: Apply the Planetary Sequence

Starting with the planet that rules the day (at sunrise), cycle through the Chaldean order:

**Chaldean Order:** Saturn → Jupiter → Mars → Sun → Venus → Mercury → Moon → (repeat)

**Example for Sunday (Sun day):**

| Hour | Daytime Ruler | Nighttime Ruler |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Sun ☉ | Mercury ☿ |
| 2 | Venus ♀ | Moon ☽ |
| 3 | Mercury ☿ | Saturn ♄ |
| 4 | Moon ☽ | Jupiter ♃ |
| 5 | Saturn ♄ | Mars ♂ |
| 6 | Jupiter ♃ | Sun ☉ |
| 7 | Mars ♂ | Venus ♀ |
| 8 | Sun ☉ | Mercury ☿ |
| 9 | Venus ♀ | Moon ☽ |
| 10 | Mercury ☿ | Saturn ♄ |
| 11 | Moon ☽ | Jupiter ♃ |
| 12 | Saturn ♄ | Mars ♂ |

Then the cycle repeats starting with the planet that rules Monday (Moon) at sunrise.

## Integration with Electional Astrology

Planetary hours can be combined with **electional astrology** (choosing optimal astrological conditions) for maximum effectiveness:[^2]

**Layered timing:**
1. **Planetary hour** — Choose the hour ruled by the planet relevant to your work
2. **Natal chart** — Ensure the hour ruler is well-dignified in your natal chart
3. **Transit** — Check that the ruling planet is not retrograde or afflicted by harsh transits
4. **Lunar phase** — Align with appropriate Moon phase (waxing for growth, waning for banishing)

**Example:** To launch a business:
- Use Sun hour on Sunday (planetary hour)
- Ensure your natal Sun is not in detriment or fall (natal chart)
- Check that transiting Sun is not afflicted (transit)
- Launch during waxing Moon (lunar phase)

This creates **quadruple alignment** — hour, natal condition, transit, lunar cycle — for maximum potency.

## Angelic Invocation During Planetary Hours

Each planetary hour is governed by its corresponding **archangel**, who can be invoked during that hour for alignment, blessing, or magical work.[^3]

### Basic Invocation Formula

**Setup:**
1. Begin within the appropriate planetary hour
2. Face the direction associated with the archangel (or East as default)
3. Light a candle and incense corresponding to the planet
4. Have symbols of the planet present (colors, metals, images)

**Invocation:**

*"I call upon [Archangel Name], ruler of [Planet] and governor of this hour.
As the [Planet] shines in the heavens, so does your light illuminate my work.
I ask for your blessing, guidance, and power in [specific intention].
Grant me [planetary quality — e.g., Michael: courage, Gabriel: clarity, Raphael: healing].
By the authority of the [Planet] and the grace of the Divine,
I align my will with cosmic order.
So it is. Amen."*

**Closing:**
- Thank the archangel
- Release the energy
- Ground and center

**Example for Sun hour (Michael):**

*"I call upon Michael, archangel of the Sun and governor of this hour.
As the Sun shines in the heavens, so does your light illuminate my work.
I ask for your blessing in my leadership and success.
Grant me courage, vitality, and divine authority.
By the power of the Sun and the grace of the Divine,
I align my will with cosmic order.
So it is. Amen."*

## Advanced Considerations

### Sect (Day vs. Night Charts)

In traditional astrology, planets have **sect** (diurnal or nocturnal affinity). Using planetary hours aligned with sect increases effectiveness:[^4]

**Diurnal (day) planets:** Sun ☉, Jupiter ♃, Saturn ♄
**Nocturnal (night) planets:** Moon ☽, Venus ♀, Mars ♂
**Neutral:** Mercury ☿

**Application:** Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn are stronger during the day; Moon, Venus, and Mars are stronger at night. Mercury adapts to either.

### Magical Hours (Double Rulership)

Certain hours are ruled by the **same planet twice** in a row (planetary hour + day ruler match). These are especially powerful for that planet's work.

**Example:** Sunday, first hour after sunrise = Sun hour on Sun day = **double Sun power** (ideal for solar magic)

### Combining with Lunar Mansions

For even more precise timing, combine planetary hours with the **28 Lunar Mansions** (the Moon's position in the zodiac by day). Each mansion has specific qualities and is favorable or unfavorable for certain actions.
