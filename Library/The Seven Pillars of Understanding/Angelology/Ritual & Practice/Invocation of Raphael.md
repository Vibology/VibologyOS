# Invocation of Raphael
*Calling the Healer — Prayer for Divine Healing, Guidance, and Safe Passage*

---

## What the Invocation of Raphael Is

The **Invocation of Raphael** is a ritual prayer calling upon **Raphael** (רפאל, *Rafa'el*, "God Heals"), the archangel who governs healing, scientific knowledge, safe travel, and the restoration of sight—both physical and spiritual. Raphael is the divine physician, the guide who walks beside travelers (as he did with Tobias), and the intelligence that illuminates the mind with clarity after confusion.[^1]

The invocation serves multiple purposes:
1. **Physical healing** — Recovery from illness, injury, or chronic conditions
2. **Emotional healing** — Release from trauma, grief, heartbreak, or depression
3. **Mental clarity** — Restoration of cognitive function, focus, or rationality after mental fog
4. **Spiritual guidance** — Direction through crisis, confusion, or loss of faith
5. **Safe passage** — Protection during travel (journeys physical, psychological, or spiritual)
6. **Scientific insight** — Revelation of knowledge, understanding of natural laws, medical breakthroughs

Unlike petitionary prayer (asking God to intervene), **angelic invocation** is a direct address to the intelligence itself—calling Raphael by name, by office, by planetary and Qabalistic correspondences, inviting his presence to manifest within the practitioner's sphere.

## Raphael's Correspondences and Attributes

To invoke Raphael effectively, the practitioner must understand his **signatures**—the cosmic coordinates where his intelligence is most accessible:[^2]

### Qabalistic Position
- **Primary Sphere:** [[Tiphareth]] (תפארת, "Beauty") — The sixth sephirah, the solar center, the heart of the Tree of Life
- **Secondary Sphere:** [[Hod]] (הוד, "Glory/Splendor") — The eighth sephirah, ruled by Mercury, governing intellect and communication

**Why both spheres?**
Raphael's essence is **solar** (the healing light of Tiphareth, the physician who restores wholeness), but his *function* is **mercurial** (the messenger who delivers remedies, the traveler who guides journeys, the intellect that solves problems). He is the Sun's healing warmth delivered through Mercury's swift hands.[^3]

### Planetary Rulership
- **Sun (☉):** Healing through warmth, vitality, life force restoration
- **Mercury (☿):** Healing through knowledge, communication, precision, skill

### Elemental Attribution
- **Air:** Breath (*ruach*, *pneuma*), the life-giving spirit. Healing begins with the breath—inhale the divine presence, exhale the illness.

### Days and Hours
- **Sunday (Solar):** Raphael's primary day, aligned with Tiphareth and the Sun
- **Wednesday (Mercurial):** Raphael's secondary day, aligned with Hod and Mercury

For maximum potency, invoke Raphael:
- **At dawn** (sunrise, the eastern quarter, Raphael's traditional station in the [[The Four Quarters]])
- **During the planetary hour of the Sun or Mercury** (calculate using planetary hour tables)
- **On Sundays or Wednesdays**

### Colors and Symbols
- **Gold or yellow** (solar, Tiphareth)
- **Orange or amber** (the dawn sky, the transition from darkness to light)
- **Green** (healing, growth, renewal)
- **Caduceus** (staff with two serpents)—Raphael's primary symbol, representing the union of opposites (the two snakes), the spine (kundalini, the central channel), and the healing arts

### Scriptural Source: The Book of Tobit
Raphael's most detailed biblical appearance is in the **Book of Tobit** (Deuterocanonical/Apocryphal):[^4]

**The story:**
Tobias, son of the blind Tobit, is sent on a dangerous journey to recover money owed to his family. Raphael, disguised as a human traveler named Azarias, volunteers to accompany him. Along the way:
- Raphael teaches Tobias to catch a fish and harvest its organs (gall, heart, liver) for healing remedies
- They drive away the demon Asmodeus (who had killed Sarah's seven previous husbands) using the smoke of the fish's heart and liver
- Upon returning, Raphael instructs Tobias to anoint his father's eyes with the fish gall—restoring Tobit's sight
- Raphael reveals his true identity: *"I am Raphael, one of the seven angels who stand before the glory of the Lord"* (Tobit 12:15)

**The lesson:**
Raphael is the **active healer**—he does not passively bless but *teaches* the remedies, *guides* the action, *applies* the cure. He is the divine physician who shows humans how to heal themselves and others.

## The Invocation: Step-by-Step Protocol

The following is a **Golden Dawn-influenced protocol** combining Qabalistic structure, elemental visualization, and scriptural invocation.[^5]

### Preparation

1. **Time:** Dawn, Sunday, or Wednesday. Planetary hour of Sun or Mercury if calculable.
2. **Space:** Face **East** (Raphael's traditional quarter). If possible, work near an open window (Air element).
3. **Altar items (optional but traditional):**
   - Yellow or gold candle
   - Incense: frankincense (solar) or lavender (mercurial/healing)
   - Bowl of water (for purification)
   - Image or symbol of Raphael (icon, caduceus, the Hebrew letters רפאל)
4. **State of consciousness:**
   - Fast or eat lightly beforehand
   - If invoking for another's healing, hold their name or image in mind
   - Approach with **humility** (the healer does not command but petitions)

### Step 1: Purification and Grounding

**Stand facing East.**

Perform the **Qabalistic Cross** (see [[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]] for full instructions):

> **Hebrew:**
> *Ateh, Malkuth, ve-Geburah, ve-Gedulah, le-Olahm, Amen*
>
> **Translation:**
> *"Thou art, the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, forever. Amen."*

This aligns the practitioner vertically (Heaven to Earth) and horizontally (East to West), establishing the microcosmic cross within the body.

### Step 2: Invocation of the Divine Name

Call upon the **divine name** governing Tiphareth before addressing the archangel:

> **Hebrew:**
> *IHVH Eloah va-Daath* (יהוה אלוה ודעת)
>
> **Translation:**
> *"LORD God of Knowledge"*

This is the divine name of Tiphareth—the god-form mediating between the higher (Kether) and lower (Malkuth) realms. By invoking this name, you establish the **channel** through which Raphael's intelligence descends.

### Step 3: The Invocation of Raphael

**Raise your arms toward the East (palms open, receptive).**

Speak aloud with intention:

> *"I conjure thee, Raphael, by the living God—*
> *By the name IHVH Eloah va-Daath,*
> *By the sphere of Tiphareth, the Beauty at the Heart of the Tree,*
> *By the Sun in its splendor and Mercury in its swiftness,*
> *I call upon thee, divine Healer and Guide.*
>
> *Raphael, thou who didst heal the blindness of Tobit,*
> *Thou who didst guide Tobias through peril to safety,*
> *Thou who dost stand before the Throne bearing the prayers of the suffering—*
> *Descend now into this circle.*
>
> *Bring thy caduceus of healing,*
> *Bring thy light of understanding,*
> *Bring thy breath of life.*
>
> *Heal [name the affliction or person],*
> *Restore what has been broken,*
> *Illuminate what has been darkened,*
> *Guide what has been lost.*
>
> *By thy office and by thy love,*
> *By the glory of the Most High who sends thee,*
> *Come, Raphael, and be present here.*
> *So mote it be."*

### Step 4: Visualization

As you speak the invocation, **visualize:**

1. **Golden-yellow light** descending from above (the Sun, Tiphareth), concentrating in the East
2. The light coalesces into a **human-like form**—robed in yellow and green, holding the caduceus
3. Raphael's face is serene, compassionate, radiant
4. From his hands or staff, **rays of healing light** extend toward you (or toward the person being healed)
5. You feel **warmth** in your heart or solar plexus—the signature of Tiphareth activation

**Breathe deeply.**
With each inhalation, draw in Raphael's healing presence (golden light filling your lungs).
With each exhalation, release the illness, pain, or confusion (grey smoke dissipating).

### Step 5: Petition or Dialogue

If the invocation is for **healing**, speak your petition clearly:

> *"Raphael, I ask thy aid in healing [specific condition]. I trust in the divine will—if it be for the highest good, grant restoration. If not, grant acceptance and the wisdom to understand the lesson within the suffering."*

If the invocation is for **guidance**, pose your question:

> *"Raphael, I seek clarity on [specific issue]. Show me the path. Illuminate the way forward."*

**Then, wait in silence.**
Raphael's response may come as:
- A sudden insight or understanding (mercurial flash)
- A feeling of warmth or peace (solar presence)
- A dream that night containing the answer
- A synchronistic event within the next few days

### Step 6: Gratitude and License to Depart

**Do not dismiss Raphael abruptly.** Thank him and release him with honor:

> *"Raphael, divine Healer and Guide,*
> *I thank thee for thy presence and thy aid.*
> *May peace be between thee and me,*
> *And may the blessings of the Most High attend thee.*
> *Go if thou must, stay if thou wilt,*
> *But harm none in thy departing.*
> *Hail and farewell."*

### Step 7: Closing

Perform the **Qabalistic Cross** again to seal the working.

Extinguish the candle. Ground yourself (eat, drink water, physical activity).

## When to Invoke Raphael

### Primary Uses
- **Serious illness** (cancer, infection, neurological disease)—invoke daily at dawn
- **Mental fog or confusion** (decision paralysis, cognitive impairment)—invoke on Wednesday (Mercury day)
- **Grief or heartbreak** (emotional wounds blocking life force)—invoke on Sunday (solar restoration)
- **Before surgery** (invoking the divine physician to guide the surgeon's hands)
- **Before travel** (especially dangerous journeys or psychological transitions)

### Contraindications
- **Do not invoke Raphael to avoid medical treatment.** Raphael *works through* doctors, therapists, and healers—he does not replace them. The Book of Tobit demonstrates this: Raphael teaches the *remedy* (fish gall), but Tobias must *apply* it.
- **Do not invoke obsessively.** If no response comes after a week of daily invocations, step back. The answer may be "no" or "not yet." Trust the wave (emotional authority) and the timing.

## Integration with Medical Treatment

Raphael is the patron of **both esoteric healing and scientific medicine**. He is not opposed to empirical knowledge—he governs it. The caduceus is both the symbol of angelic healing and the modern medical profession.

**Suggested integration:**
1. **Before diagnosis:** Invoke Raphael for clarity—that the doctors see accurately, that tests reveal truth
2. **Before treatment:** Invoke Raphael to guide the practitioners' hands, to activate the medicine's efficacy
3. **During recovery:** Invoke Raphael daily for vitality, for the body's natural regeneration to accelerate
4. **For chronic conditions:** Invoke Raphael not for *cure* (which may not be the will) but for *acceptance*, *adaptation*, and *making meaning* from the limitation

---

## Psychological Function: Healing the Split

From a Jungian perspective, illness (physical or psychic) is often a **symptom of splitting**—the ego at war with the body, the conscious mind refusing the unconscious, the persona denying the [[The Shadow]].[^6]

**Raphael as healer:**
Raphael's caduceus—the two serpents winding around the central staff—represents the **union of opposites**:
- **Conscious and unconscious** (the two snakes)
- **Ascending and descending currents** (spiritual aspiration and instinctual grounding)
- **The reconciliation** (the central staff, the spine, the axis mundi)

To invoke Raphael is to invite the **Transcendent Function** (see [[The Transcendent Function]])—the psyche's capacity to create a third thing (the healing symbol) that unites what was split.

**The practitioner's question:**
*"What am I refusing to integrate? What part of myself have I exiled, and is now manifesting as illness?"*

Raphael does not simply remove symptoms—he illuminates the **meaning** within the suffering, so that the lesson can be learned and the symptom released.

---

## The Observatory Lens: Raphael as the Clarifying Intelligence

From the Observatory, Raphael is the **intelligence of discernment and precision**—the force that brings blurred vision into focus, both literally (healing Tobit's blindness) and figuratively (revealing truth after confusion).[^7]

**The practitioner invokes Raphael when:**
- The instruments are fogged (perception unclear, data contradictory)
- The lenses need recalibration (mental models broken, paradigms failing)
- The observer is disoriented (lost in the psychoid layer without reference points)

Raphael is not the vision itself—he is the **restoration of the capacity to see**. He does not tell you what to perceive; he clears the obstruction so you can perceive correctly.

**Practical result:**
After invoking Raphael, practitioners commonly report:
- Sudden clarity on a decision that was previously paralyzing
- A doctor discovering the correct diagnosis after months of uncertainty
- Emotional release (tears, laughter, deep breathing) that restores vitality
- Synchronistic encounters with healers, teachers, or information

These are not "miracles" in the naive sense—they are the **restoration of flow** where there was blockage. Raphael removes the obstacle; the healing is the natural result.

## Variations and Adaptations

### Simple Daily Invocation (2 minutes)

For those without ceremonial training or time for full protocol:

**At dawn, face East. Say aloud:**

> *"Raphael, divine Healer, I call upon you.*
> *Bring your light into my body, my heart, my mind.*
> *Heal what is broken. Restore what is lost.*
> *Guide me through this day with clarity and grace.*
> *I trust in the divine will.*
> *Thank you, Raphael. Amen."*

**Breathe deeply three times.** Visualize golden light filling your chest. Proceed with your day.

### Intercessory Invocation (for another person)

If invoking for someone else's healing:

> *"Raphael, I ask not for myself but for [name].*
> *They suffer from [condition].*
> *If it be the divine will, bring healing.*
> *If not, bring acceptance and peace.*
> *I offer this prayer in love and humility.*
> *May thy will be done."*

**Important:** Do not invoke for another without their knowledge or consent (exception: unconscious patients, infants). To impose healing on another without permission is a violation of their autonomy—and Raphael, who respects free will, will not cooperate.

### Integration with the Four Quarters

The full [[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]] invokes Raphael in the East as part of the archangel square:

> *"Before me, Raphael.*
> *Behind me, Gabriel.*
> *On my right hand, Michael.*
> *On my left hand, Uriel.*
> *About me flame the pentagrams,*
> *Within me shines the six-rayed star."*

This places Raphael **before** the practitioner (in front, leading the way), which reinforces his role as **guide**—the one who goes ahead, clearing the path.

---

## Raphael in Other Traditions

### Christian Tradition
Raphael appears in the **Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican** traditions as one of the three named archangels (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael). His feast day is **September 29** (Michaelmas, shared with Michael and Gabriel).

The **Chaplet of St. Raphael** is a devotional prayer invoking his intercession for healing, safe travel, and happy marriages (based on his role in arranging Tobias and Sarah's union).

### Islamic Tradition
In Islam, Raphael is identified with **Israfil** (إسرافيل), the archangel who will blow the trumpet to announce the Day of Resurrection. However, the healing/travel associations are less emphasized in Islamic angelology.

### Hermetic and Alchemical Tradition
Raphael is associated with **Mercury (Hermes)**, the god of alchemy, the psychopomp (guide of souls), and the revealer of hidden knowledge. The alchemical **caduceus** (Hermes' staff) and Raphael's caduceus are the same symbol—representing the **union of opposites** necessary for the Great Work.[^8]
