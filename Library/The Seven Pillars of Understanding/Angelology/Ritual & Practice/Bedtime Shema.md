# Bedtime Shema
*Kriat Shema al HaMitah — Jewish Evening Prayer for Divine Protection and Angelic Guardianship*

---

## What the Bedtime Shema Is

The **Bedtime Shema** (*Kriat Shema al HaMitah*, קריאת שמע על המיטה, "Recitation of the Shema Upon the Bed") is a Jewish liturgical practice performed before sleep, invoking divine protection and angelic guardianship through the vulnerable night hours.[^1]

The prayer serves multiple functions:
1. **Entrusting the soul to God** — The sleeper surrenders consciousness to divine care, trusting that the soul will be returned upon waking
2. **Invoking angelic protection** — The four archangels (Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael) are called to guard the four directions around the bed
3. **Confession and forgiveness** — The practitioner reviews the day, confesses wrongs, and releases grievances before sleep
4. **Protection from nocturnal dangers** — The prayer wards against demons (particularly Lilith), nightmares, and spiritual attack during sleep

The Bedtime Shema transforms sleep from a passive, vulnerable state into a **sacred act**—a nightly rehearsal of death and resurrection, where the soul ascends to divine realms and returns purified at dawn.

## The Complete Text and Translation

The Bedtime Shema is not a single prayer but a **liturgical sequence** combining biblical verses, confessions, and the angelic invocation. Below is the core structure:[^2]

### Part 1: The Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4)

**Hebrew:**
> **שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ יְהוָה אֶחָד**
>
> *Shema Yisra'el, Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai echad*

**Translation:**
> "Hear, O Israel: The LORD is our God, the LORD is One."

This is the central declaration of Jewish faith—the affirmation of divine unity. It is recited twice daily (morning and evening) and at death. Before sleep, it serves as the **anchor** of consciousness, reminding the practitioner of the underlying oneness to which all returns.

### Part 2: The Angelic Invocation

**Hebrew:**
> **בְּשֵׁם אֲדֹנָי אֱלֹהֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל: מִימִינִי מִיכָאֵל, וּמִשְּׂמֹאלִי גַּבְרִיאֵל, וּמִלְּפָנַי אוּרִיאֵל, וּמֵאֲחוֹרַי רְפָאֵל, וְעַל רֹאשִׁי שְׁכִינַת אֵל**
>
> *B'shem Adonai Elohei Yisrael: Mi-y'mini Mikha'el, u'mi-s'moli Gavri'el, u'mi-l'fanai Uri'el, u'mei-achorai R'fa'el, v'al roshi Sh'khinat El*

**Translation:**
> "In the name of the LORD, God of Israel:
> On my right, Michael,
> And on my left, Gabriel,
> And before me, Uriel,
> And behind me, Raphael,
> And above my head, the Shekinah of God."

**Visualization:** As each archangel is named, visualize their presence:
- **Michael (right side):** Red/crimson light, holding a flaming sword, strength and protection
- **Gabriel (left side):** Blue/silver light, holding a chalice or lily, revelation and intuition
- **Uriel (front):** Earth-tone light (russet, olive), holding a lantern or book, grounding and wisdom
- **Raphael (behind):** Yellow/golden light, holding a caduceus, healing and safe passage
- **Shekinah (above):** Radiant feminine divine presence, the indwelling of God, protective canopy

The practitioner lies in bed surrounded by the four archangels and covered by the Shekinah—a five-fold protection forming a sacred mandala.

### Part 3: Confession and Forgiveness

**Traditional formula:**
> "Master of the Universe, I forgive all who have angered or vexed me, or sinned against me, whether against my body, my property, my honor, or anything that is mine. May no person be punished on my account.
>
> May it be Your will, O LORD my God and God of my ancestors, that I sin no more. Whatever sins I have committed before You, erase in Your abundant mercy, but not through suffering."

This is the nightly **release**—the practitioner forgives all wrongs (real or perceived), releases attachment to grudges, and asks for divine mercy without the need for punitive suffering.

### Part 4: Psalm 91 (Optional but Traditional)

**Opening verses:**
> "He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
> I will say to the LORD, 'My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.'
> For He will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence..."

Psalm 91 is the **psalm of protection**, promising divine deliverance from dangers seen and unseen. It is often recited in full as part of the Bedtime Shema, reinforcing the theme of angelic guardianship.

## Talmudic and Kabbalistic Origins

The Bedtime Shema has roots in **Talmudic practice** (compiled ~500 CE) and was elaborated by medieval Kabbalists.[^3]

### Talmudic Foundation
The Talmud (*Berakhot* 60b) prescribes specific blessings and prayers for transitional moments—entering a city, leaving a city, beginning a meal, going to sleep. Sleep is understood as a **minor death** (one-sixtieth of death, according to the Talmud), and waking is a **minor resurrection**. The Bedtime Shema ritualizes this threshold, ensuring the soul's safe passage.

### Kabbalistic Development
Medieval Kabbalah (12th-16th centuries) emphasized the **dangers of sleep**:
- The soul ascends during sleep, leaving the body vulnerable
- Demons and *shedim* (harmful spirits) roam at night
- **Lilith**, the night demon and Adam's rejected first wife, preys upon sleeping men and children

The four archangels in the Bedtime Shema serve as **guardians** against these nocturnal threats. The **Shekinah** (divine feminine presence) hovers above the bed as a protective canopy, preventing demonic intrusion.[^4]

The Kabbalists also understood the Bedtime Shema as a **micro-death initiation**—the practitioner rehearses surrender, release, and trust, preparing the soul for the ultimate transition at life's end.

## The Body-Centered Four Quarters

Unlike the [[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]], which uses compass directions (East, South, West, North), the Bedtime Shema uses a **body-centered** orientation:[^5]

| Position | Archangel | Element | Function |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Right** | Michael | Fire | Strength, defense, right hand of God |
| **Left** | Gabriel | Water | Revelation, intuition, receptivity |
| **Front** | Uriel | Earth | Grounding, illumination of darkness ahead |
| **Behind** | Raphael | Air | Healing, safe passage, protection from what pursues |
| **Above** | Shekinah | Divine Presence | Sheltering canopy, feminine aspect of God |

**Why body-centered?**
The practitioner lies in bed, facing an arbitrary direction (not necessarily East). The archangels surround the **body** (the vulnerable physical vessel during sleep) rather than the room. This makes the Bedtime Shema portable—it works regardless of bed orientation or location.

**Contrast with ceremonial magic:**
- **Ceremonial (LBRP):** Compass-oriented, standing, active, creating sacred space in the environment
- **Bedtime Shema:** Body-oriented, lying down, receptive, creating sacred protection around the individual

## Protective Function: Warding Against Lilith and Nocturnal Demons

The Bedtime Shema's protective function is not merely symbolic—it reflects a **cosmology of night dangers** present in Jewish folklore and Kabbalah.[^6]

### Lilith: The Night Demon
**Lilith** appears in Jewish tradition as:
- Adam's first wife (before Eve), created equal but refusing submission, cast out and becoming a demon
- The "screech owl" of Isaiah 34:14 (in some translations)
- A child-killer and seducer of men during sleep (nocturnal emissions attributed to Lilith)

Lilith is the **archetype of the devouring feminine**—the shadow side of the Great Mother, the witch who steals infants, the succubus who drains vitality. She is most active at night, when consciousness is unguarded.

The Bedtime Shema wards against Lilith by:
- Invoking the **Shekinah** (the holy feminine) as counterbalance to Lilith (the demonic feminine)
- Surrounding the sleeper with archangels who prevent her approach
- Declaring divine names that Lilith cannot abide

### Other Nocturnal Threats
Jewish folklore identifies multiple nocturnal dangers:
- **Shedim** (demons) — Harmful spirits that cause illness, accidents, and nightmares
- **Mazikin** (harmful forces) — General category of invisible destroyers
- **Nightmares** — Understood not as brain activity but as demonic visitations

The Bedtime Shema creates a **sacred boundary** that these forces cannot cross. The practitioner sleeps within the **circle of archangels**, covered by the Shekinah, entrusted to divine care.

## Psychological Function: Sleep as Ego-Death Rehearsal

From a Jungian perspective, the Bedtime Shema ritualizes the nightly **dissolution of ego-consciousness** that occurs during sleep.[^7]

**Sleep as liminal state:**
- The ego (waking consciousness) dissolves
- The unconscious takes precedence (dreams, REM activity)
- The psyche is vulnerable to flooding by repressed material, complexes, and archetypal forces
- The individual rehearses **ego-death**—the temporary cessation of identity

**Without ritual protection:**
- Sleep is chaotic, unguarded
- Nightmares arise from unintegrated shadow material
- The practitioner may wake disoriented, drained, or disturbed

**With the Bedtime Shema:**
- Sleep is ritualized as **sacred surrender**
- The four archangels (psychological guardians) prevent overwhelming by unconscious contents
- The Shekinah (the Self, the divine center) provides a protective canopy
- The practitioner wakes **renewed**, having descended safely and returned

The archangels can be understood as:
- **Michael:** The ego's defensive function (protecting against overwhelming shadow material)
- **Gabriel:** The intuitive function (guiding the dreamer through the unconscious)
- **Uriel:** The grounding function (ensuring the soul returns to the body)
- **Raphael:** The healing function (integrating dream material without trauma)

The Bedtime Shema ensures that the nightly descent into the unconscious is **contained** rather than chaotic.

## Modern Practice: Adaptation and Integration

The Bedtime Shema can be practiced by Jews and non-Jews alike, though non-Jews may wish to adapt the language to their own tradition.

### Traditional Practice (Jewish)
1. Sit on the edge of the bed.
2. Recite the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4).
3. Recite the angelic invocation (Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Shekinah).
4. Offer confession and forgiveness.
5. Recite Psalm 91 (or other protective psalms).
6. Lie down and sleep, trusting in divine protection.

### Adapted Practice (Non-Denominational)
1. Sit on the edge of the bed.
2. Affirm divine unity: *"God is One. All things return to the Source."*
3. Invoke the four archangels:
   - *"Michael, stand at my right hand. Protect me with your sword of truth."*
   - *"Gabriel, stand at my left hand. Guide me with your cup of wisdom."*
   - *"Uriel, stand before me. Light my path through the darkness."*
   - *"Raphael, stand behind me. Heal what I carry and grant safe passage."*
   - *"Divine Presence, shelter me above. I rest beneath your wings."*
4. Release the day: *"I forgive all who have harmed me. I ask forgiveness for my failings. I release all attachments. I entrust my soul to God."*
5. Lie down and sleep.

## Integration with Other Practices

### With the LBRP
The Bedtime Shema can be combined with the [[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]]:
1. Perform the LBRP standing (banishes the room, establishes quarters)
2. Perform the Bedtime Shema lying in bed (protects the body, entrusts the soul)

This provides **two layers of protection**: the room is cleared (LBRP), and the individual is guarded (Bedtime Shema).

### With Contemplative Prayer
The Bedtime Shema serves as a **bookend** to the day:
- **Morning:** [[Contemplative Prayer]] or [[Invocation]] (active engagement with the divine)
- **Evening:** Bedtime Shema (receptive surrender to the divine)

This rhythm mirrors the breath—inhalation (morning, drawing in divine presence) and exhalation (evening, releasing the day).

### With Dream Work
The Bedtime Shema prepares consciousness for **intentional dreaming**. By invoking the archangels and Shekinah before sleep, the practitioner signals to the unconscious: *"I am protected. I am ready to receive what needs to be seen."* Dreams arising after the Bedtime Shema tend to be clearer, more numinous, and easier to integrate.

## The Observatory Lens: Sleep as Descent to the Psychoid Layer

From the Observatory, sleep is understood as a **nightly descent to the psychoid layer**—the dimension where psyche and matter, consciousness and world, are unified (see [[Psychoid Archetype]]).[^8]

During waking life, the ego maintains the **subject-object split** (I am here, the world is there). During sleep, this split dissolves:
- Dreams blend inner and outer (the house you dream of is both "in your head" and an autonomous symbolic reality)
- Synchronicities are seeded (the dreams tonight may correspond to tomorrow's outer events)
- The soul touches the **unus mundus** (the One World underlying multiplicity)

**Without protection:**
The descent is dangerous—the psyche can be overwhelmed by archetypal forces, flooded by collective shadow, or captured by complexes.

**With the Bedtime Shema:**
The archangels stand guard at the **threshold**, allowing safe passage between the layers. The Shekinah ensures the soul's return at dawn. The practitioner descends to the psychoid layer, receives what is needed (healing, insight, revelation), and ascends renewed.

Sleep is not unconsciousness—it is **deep consciousness**, where the instruments of the Observatory are recalibrated nightly.
