## Overview

The **Bedtime Shema** (*Kriat Shema al HaMitah*, קריאת שמע על המיטה) is a Jewish liturgical practice performed before sleep, invoking divine protection and angelic guardianship through the night.

The prayer includes:
1. The **Shema** (Deuteronomy 6:4) — "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One"
2. Invocation of the **four archangels**: [[Michael]] (right), [[Gabriel]] (left), [[Uriel]] (front), [[Raphael]] (behind), with the [[Shekinah]] (divine presence) above
3. Confession and forgiveness
4. Psalm 91 (protection)

The Bedtime Shema creates a sacred boundary around sleep, inviting angelic protection and purification during the vulnerable night hours.
