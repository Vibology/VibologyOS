## Overview

**The Celestial Hierarchy** (*De Coelesti Hierarchia*) is a 5th-century theological treatise attributed to **Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite**, establishing the definitive Christian classification of angels into **nine orders** arranged in **three triads**:

### The Three Triads

| Triad | Orders | Function |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **First Triad** | [[Seraphim]], [[Cherubim]], [[Thrones]] | Closest to God; contemplate divine essence |
| **Second Triad** | [[Dominations]], [[Virtues]], [[Powers]] | Govern cosmic order; mediate divine will |
| **Third Triad** | [[Principalities]], [[Archangels]], [[Angels]] | Closest to humanity; execute divine commands |

This hierarchy became the standard angelology of medieval Christianity and profoundly influenced Western esotericism, including Qabalistic angelology.

## The Dionysian Principle

Pseudo-Dionysius taught that divine illumination flows **downward** through the hierarchy—each order receiving light from those above and transmitting it to those below. This creates a **chain of being** from pure divine unity to material creation.
