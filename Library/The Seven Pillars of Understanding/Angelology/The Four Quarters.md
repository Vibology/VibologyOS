# The Four Quarters
*The Elemental Directions in Ceremonial Magic*

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

The **Four Quarters** are the cardinal directions associated with the four classical elements in Western ceremonial magic:

| Quarter | Direction | Element | Archangel | Time | Season |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|------|--------|
| **East** | Sunrise | Air | [[Raphael]] | Dawn | Spring |
| **South** | Zenith | Fire | [[Michael]] | Noon | Summer |
| **West** | Sunset | Water | [[Gabriel]] | Dusk | Autumn |
| **North** | Nadir | Earth | [[Uriel]] | Midnight | Winter |

This system underlies the **Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram** ([[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]]), the **Watchtower system** of Enochian magic, and countless other Western magical practices.

## Elemental Attributions

The quarter-element correspondences derive from observing the natural world:
- **East/Air:** The sun rises in the east; dawn brings fresh air
- **South/Fire:** The sun reaches its zenith in the south; maximum heat
- **West/Water:** The sun sets over the western ocean; evening moisture
- **North/Earth:** The midnight sun is hidden below; solid darkness
