## Overview

The **Invocation of Raphael** is a ritual prayer calling upon [[Raphael]] (רפאל, "God Heals"), the archangel of [[Tiphareth]] and commander of the [[Virtues]], for healing, guidance, and divine intervention.

Raphael is invoked for:
- **Physical healing** (illness, injury, recovery)
- **Emotional healing** (trauma, grief, heartbreak)
- **Spiritual healing** (restoration of faith, guidance through crisis)
- **Safe travel** (Raphael guides Tobias in the Book of Tobit)

Traditional invocations include visualization of golden-green light, the element of Air (breath, spirit), and the caduceus symbol. Raphael's presence is felt as warmth in the heart or solar plexus.
