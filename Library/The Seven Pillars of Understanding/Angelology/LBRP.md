## Overview

The **Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram** (LBRP) is the foundational ritual of Western ceremonial magic, developed by the **Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn** in the late 19th century. It serves to:

1. **Banish** unwanted influences and energies
2. **Establish** sacred space and personal protection
3. **Invoke** the four archangels as guardians
4. **Balance** the practitioner within the elemental forces

The LBRP is often the first ritual learned by students of ceremonial magic and may be performed daily as a spiritual hygiene practice.
