# Satan
*The Adversary — Accuser, Tempter, and Shadow of God*

---

## What Satan Is

**Satan** (Hebrew שָׂטָן, *satan* — "adversary," "accuser," "one who opposes") is one of the most complex and evolving figures in Western religious tradition—simultaneously an **angel of God's court**, a **fallen rebel**, the **tempter of humanity**, and the **personification of evil**. The name "Satan" is not originally a proper name but a title or function: *ha-satan* ("the adversary")—one who opposes, tests, or accuses.[^1]

**The evolution:**
1. **Hebrew Bible (Old Testament)** — Satan is a member of God's divine council, serving as the "prosecutor" who tests human faithfulness (Book of Job, Zechariah)
2. **Second Temple Judaism** — Satan becomes associated with the fallen angel narrative (Book of Enoch), transforming from God's servant to God's enemy
3. **Christianity** — Satan is fully identified with the Devil, the serpent in Eden, and the ruler of Hell
4. **Islam** — Iblis (Satan) refuses to bow to Adam and is cast out, becoming the tempter of humanity
5. **Qabalah** — Satan is associated with the Qlippoth, the shadow side of the Tree of Life, and paired with Samael

**The paradox:** Satan is both **necessary** (the force that tests, challenges, and reveals) and **destructive** (the force that separates, accuses, and damns). He is the cosmic prosecutor, the psychic shadow, and the principle of division.

## Satan in the Hebrew Bible: The Divine Prosecutor

In the earliest Hebrew texts, **ha-satan** ("the adversary") is not a fallen rebel but a **member of God's heavenly court**, functioning as a kind of divine prosecutor or tester.[^2]

### The Book of Job (6th-4th century BCE)

The most detailed portrayal of Satan in the Hebrew Bible. Here, Satan is one of the *bene Elohim* ("sons of God") who present themselves before the Lord.[^3]

**The scene (Job 1:6-12):**
- Satan appears among the divine beings in God's court
- God asks Satan where he has come from; Satan replies, "From roaming through the earth"
- God points to Job as a righteous man
- **Satan accuses:** "Does Job fear God for nothing? You have blessed him—remove your protection and he will curse you to your face"
- God permits Satan to test Job (but not to kill him)

**Satan's role:** The skeptic, the tester, the one who questions human righteousness. He does not act independently—he operates *with God's permission*, serving as the instrument of divine testing.

**Key insight:** This Satan is not yet "the Devil"—he is a function within the divine order, the force that reveals whether faith is genuine or conditional.

### Zechariah 3:1-2 (6th century BCE)

Satan appears as **the accuser** in the divine courtroom:

*"Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. And the LORD said to Satan, 'The LORD rebuke you, O Satan!'"*

**Satan's function:** The prosecutor bringing charges, the voice of condemnation. God (or God's angel) defends against Satan's accusations.

**The dynamic:** Satan represents the principle of **judgment, accusation, and opposition**—not yet rebellion, but the adversarial force within God's own court.

## The Fall: Satan as Rebel

By the Second Temple period (200 BCE - 70 CE), Jewish apocalyptic literature began identifying Satan with **the fallen angel** who rebelled against God. This tradition merges Satan with other figures:

- **The serpent in Eden** (Genesis 3) — Later interpreted as Satan in disguise, tempting Eve
- **The shining one cast down** (Isaiah 14:12) — "How you have fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn!" (later identified as Lucifer/Satan)
- **The proud angel** (Ezekiel 28:12-17) — The King of Tyre described in terms that suggest a fallen heavenly being

**The synthesis:** Satan was once a high angel (perhaps the highest) who rebelled out of pride, was cast down, and now opposes God and tempts humanity. This narrative does not appear fully formed in the Hebrew Bible but develops in intertestamental texts like **1 Enoch** and later Christian theology.

See [[Lucifer]] for the full narrative of the Light-Bearer's fall and the relationship between Lucifer and Satan as names/identities.

## Satan in Christianity: The Devil and the Tempter

In the New Testament, **Satan is fully personified as the Devil**—the cosmic enemy of God, the ruler of this fallen world, and the tempter of Christ.[^4]

### The Temptation of Christ (Matthew 4, Luke 4)

Satan tempts Jesus in the wilderness, offering worldly power in exchange for worship:

1. "Turn stones into bread" (temptation to use divine power for personal need)
2. "Throw yourself from the temple; angels will save you" (temptation to test God)
3. "I will give you all the kingdoms of the world if you worship me" (temptation to worldly power)

Jesus rejects all three, quoting scripture to resist. **Satan's method:** Twisting scripture, offering shortcuts to the divine purpose, appealing to ego and survival.

### Satan as Accuser and Destroyer

Throughout the New Testament, Satan is:
- **The accuser** (Revelation 12:10) — "The accuser of our brothers has been thrown down"
- **The tempter** (1 Thessalonians 3:5) — Leading humanity into sin
- **The father of lies** (John 8:44) — The principle of deception
- **The ruler of this world** (John 12:31) — The force governing the fallen material realm
- **The enemy** (Matthew 13:39) — Sowing weeds among the wheat

**The Christian synthesis:** Satan is the personification of evil—not equal to God (Christian orthodoxy rejects dualism) but a fallen creature permitted to tempt and test humanity until the final judgment.

## Satan and Samael: The Qabalistic Relationship

In Jewish mysticism (Qabalah), **Satan and Samael** are often conflated or treated as aspects of the same force.[^5]

**Samael** (Hebrew סמאל, "Venom of God" or "Poison of God") is:
- The Angel of Death
- The chief of the satans (plural—accusers/adversaries)
- The consort of Lilith (together forming the Qlippothic "Beast")
- The prince of demons and ruler of the Fifth Heaven (in some systems)

**The relationship:**
- **Samael** is the personal name; **Satan** is the function (adversary, accuser)
- Some texts treat them as identical; others distinguish Samael as the greater entity with Satan as his role
- Both are associated with Geburah (Severity) on the Tree of Life—necessary severity that becomes destructive when unbalanced

**The teaching:** Samael/Satan is not purely evil but **necessary severity**—the force that prunes, tests, destroys what must die. He becomes "evil" only when untempered by mercy (Chesed).

## Satan in the Qlippoth: Thaumiel's Archdemon

In the Qlippothic (shadow) Tree of Life, Satan is one of the **two ruling demons of Thaumiel**—the first and highest Qlippah, opposing Kether (the Crown).[^6]

**Thaumiel** ("The Twins of God") represents duality opposing unity—the split of the One into two contending forces. Its archdemons are:
1. **Satan** — The Adversary, the one who opposes and divides
2. **Moloch** — The false king, the devourer who seeks to become the One through destruction

**Satan's role in Thaumiel:**
- The principle of **opposition**—saying "No" to unity, creating duality
- The **rebel** who claims equality with God ("I will be like the Most High")
- The force that **separates**—dividing what should be united, creating the illusion of two where there is one

**The error:** Satan (as Thaumiel) believes himself to be God's equal, creating cosmic dualism. This is the root lie from which all Qlippothic distortion descends.

## Psychological Satan: The Shadow and the Adversary

From a Jungian perspective, Satan represents the **collective Shadow**—the denied, repressed, "evil" aspects of humanity projected onto a cosmic scapegoat.[^7]

**Satan as Shadow:**
- Everything the ego claims to reject (lust, rage, pride, greed, cruelty) is projected onto Satan
- Satan becomes "the source of evil," allowing humanity to deny its own darkness
- The Devil is the collective unconscious expressing what consciousness refuses to integrate

**Satan as Adversary (archetypal function):**
- The force that opposes, challenges, tests—necessary for growth
- The "loyal opposition" that prevents stagnation, complacency, inflation
- The voice that questions authority, dogma, and collective values

**The integration:**
- Recognize that "Satan" is not an external entity but the **projected shadow of the psyche**
- Withdraw the projection: own your darkness, your rebellion, your capacity for destruction
- The "Devil" dissolves when his content is integrated—he was always *your* denied self

**Jung:** *"The psychological rule says that when an inner situation is not made conscious, it happens outside, as fate. That is to say, when the individual remains undivided and does not become conscious of his inner opposite, the world must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves."*[^8]

## The Adversary as Teacher

In esoteric traditions (Gnosticism, Left-Hand Path, certain Qabalistic schools), Satan is reinterpreted as **the teacher, the liberator, the bringer of knowledge**—not the enemy of humanity but the adversary of tyranny.[^9]

**The Gnostic reversal:**
- The God of the Old Testament (the Demiurge) is the false god who imprisons humanity in matter
- The Serpent (Satan) brings gnosis—knowledge that liberates humanity from the Demiurge's control
- Satan is the Promethean figure, stealing fire (knowledge) to give to humanity

**The Left-Hand Path:**
- Satan represents **individual sovereignty**—the refusal to submit to external authority
- The Adversary is the archetype of self-determination, questioning, and transgression of limits
- "Do what thou wilt" (Crowley) — the Satanic principle of autonomous will

**The risk:** This path can lead to genuine liberation (breaking free of oppressive dogma) or to inflation (the ego claiming godhood). The difference is whether one **integrates** the Adversarial energy (using it consciously for growth) or **identifies** with it (becoming possessed by rebellion for its own sake).

## Satan in Islam: Iblis, the Refuser

In Islamic tradition, **Iblis** (derived from Greek *diabolos*, "devil") is the figure parallel to Satan—the jinn who refused to bow to Adam and was cast out of paradise.[^10]

**The Quranic account (Surah 7:11-18):**
1. God creates Adam and commands the angels to prostrate before him
2. Iblis refuses: "I am better than him; You created me from fire and created him from clay"
3. God casts Iblis out for his pride and disobedience
4. Iblis asks for and receives respite until the Day of Judgment
5. Iblis vows to lead humanity astray: "I will surely sit in wait for them on Your straight path"

**Iblis/Satan's function in Islam:**
- The tempter (*al-Shaytan*) who whispers evil suggestions into human hearts
- The test of faith—those who resist Satan's temptations prove their devotion to Allah
- The embodiment of pride, the first and greatest sin

**Key difference from Christianity:** Iblis is a **jinn** (a being created from smokeless fire), not a fallen angel. Angels in Islam cannot disobey God, but jinn have free will and can choose rebellion.
