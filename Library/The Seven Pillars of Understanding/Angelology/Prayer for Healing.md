# Prayer for Healing
*Petitionary Prayer — Invoking Divine Grace for Restoration*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Prayer for Healing** is the practice of petitioning divine grace—through God, Christ, angels, or saints—for the restoration of health, wholeness, and well-being. Healing prayer appears in all major religious traditions and may be directed toward:

- Physical ailments (illness, injury, chronic conditions)
- Emotional wounds (trauma, grief, depression, anxiety)
- Spiritual crises (loss of faith, dark night of the soul)
- Relationship healing (reconciliation, forgiveness)

Healing prayer may invoke [[Raphael]], [[Michael]], Christ as divine physician, or the [[Virtues]] (angels of miracles and grace). Effective prayer combines **faith** (trust in divine will), **surrender** (releasing attachment to specific outcomes), and **action** (seeking medical care, therapy, spiritual direction).
