# Angels of Fire
*The Burning Ones — Angelic Beings of Divine Flame*

---

## Essence

**Angels of Fire** is a broad category referring to angelic beings associated with the element of **fire**—the sacred flame that purifies, transforms, illuminates, and manifests the **divine presence** in material creation. Fire in angelology is not mere combustion but **spiritual energy**—the consuming force that burns away impurity, the transformative heat that transmutes lead into gold, the light that reveals truth.

The Angels of Fire serve multiple sacred functions:

1. **Purification** — Burning away sin, corruption, and spiritual impurity (the **refiner's fire**, Malachi 3:2)
2. **Transformation** — The alchemical flame that transmutes the soul from base matter to spiritual gold
3. **Divine Presence** — Fire as theophany—God appearing as flame (the **burning bush**, the **pillar of fire**)
4. **Judgment** — The sword of fire, the consuming wrath that destroys what cannot be redeemed

This category encompasses several specific orders and named angels:
- **[[Seraphim]]** — The "Burning Ones," highest angelic order surrounding the Throne
- **[[Ishim]]/Ashim** — "Souls of Fire" or "Flames," the tenth order at [[Malkuth]]
- **[[Michael]]** — "Ruler of Solar Fire," archangel of the South quarter
- **[[Uriel]]** — "Fire of God" or "Light of God," regent of the Sun
- **Nathaniel** — Specific "angel of fire" or "lord over fire" (Davidson)

## Theological Depth

### 1. The Seraphim: The Burning Ones

The **[[Seraphim]]** (singular: *Seraph*; Hebrew: שרפים) are the **highest order** of the celestial hierarchy, whose name literally means **"Burning Ones"** or **"Fiery Serpents"** (Gustav Davidson).[^1]

**Gustav Davidson** defines them as:

> "Angels of fire, love, and light who surround the Throne of Glory, intoning the Trisagion ('Holy, Holy, Holy')."

The term "fiery serpents" (*seraphim*) appears in **Numbers 21:6**, where God sends venomous serpents to punish the Israelites. Davidson notes that this term is sometimes interpreted as referring to the angelic order, linking the Seraphim to the **serpent of fire**—not evil, but **burning purity** that consumes what is unworthy.

#### Isaiah's Vision: The Cleansing Coal

The most famous appearance of the Seraphim is in **Isaiah 6:1-7**, where the prophet has a vision of the LORD seated on a throne:

> *"Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying. And they were calling to one another: 'Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.'"*

After Isaiah cries out in terror at his unworthiness, one of the Seraphim acts:

> *"Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. With it he touched my mouth and said, 'See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.'"* (Isaiah 6:6-7)

The **live coal** (*ritspah*, "burning stone") is the **Seraphic fire of purification**. It does not punish—it **cleanses**. The coal burns away Isaiah's impurity, rendering him fit to speak God's word. This is the essential function of the Angels of Fire: **they do not destroy the soul; they purify it through fire**.

The Seraphim are **pure love**, but love at such intensity that it manifests as flame. To be loved by a Seraph is to be consumed—not annihilated, but **refined**. Shadow cannot survive in that much light.

### 2. Biblical Fire Theophanies

Fire is the **primary medium** through which the Divine Presence manifests in the material world. Across biblical tradition, God and His angels appear **as fire**:

#### The Burning Bush (Exodus 3:2-6)

> *"There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up."*

The **angel of the LORD** (mal'akh YHWH) appeared to Moses as **fire within the bush**. Gustav Davidson identifies this angel variously as **Zagzagel** or **[[Michael]]**.

**The paradox**: The bush **burns but is not consumed**. This is the central mystery of sacred fire—it **transforms without destroying**. The bush represents matter illuminated by spirit; the fire is **divine energy** animating form without annihilating it.

God speaks from within the fire: *"I AM WHO I AM"* (Exodus 3:14)—the Name of pure Being ([[Eheieh|EHEIEH]], associated with [[Kether]]). The fire is the **manifestation** of the unmanifest Godhead.

#### The Pillar of Fire (Exodus 13:21-22)

> *"By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night."*

The **pillar of fire** led the Israelites through the wilderness. Davidson associates this with the **[[Shekinah]]** (the Divine Presence, the feminine aspect of God dwelling with Israel) or the archangel **[[Michael]]**.

**The function**: The fire provides **guidance** (light in darkness), **protection** (the pillar stands between Israel and the Egyptian army in Exodus 14:19-20), and **sustained presence** (it never abandons them).

**Symbolically**: The pillar is the **axis mundi**, the vertical connection between heaven and earth. The fire is the **flow of divine energy** descending to sustain embodied existence.

#### Mount Sinai: The Consuming Fire (Exodus 24:17)

> *"To the Israelites the glory of the LORD looked like a consuming fire on top of the mountain."*

When Moses ascends Sinai to receive the Torah, the mountain is covered in fire. The fire is **unapproachable**—anyone who touches the mountain dies (Exodus 19:12). Only Moses, purified and called, can enter the flame and survive.

**Deuteronomy 4:24** makes the principle explicit:

> *"For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God."*

This is **fire as judgment**—not arbitrary wrath, but the **incompatibility of impurity with holiness**. Sin cannot survive in the presence of the sacred; it is burned away. The "jealousy" of God is His refusal to share the soul with idols—He demands **totality**, and fire is the medium that enforces this demand.

#### Pentecost: Tongues of Fire (Acts 2:3-4)

> *"They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them."*

On the day of **Pentecost** (Greek "fiftieth," marking fifty days after Passover), the **Holy Spirit** descended upon the apostles as **tongues of fire**. This fire:
- **Illuminates** — Enabling speech, prophecy, and understanding
- **Transforms** — The disciples are no longer afraid; they become bold preachers
- **Spreads** — Fire leaps from person to person, igniting a movement that becomes Christianity

The fire here is **pentecostal fire**—the fire of inspiration, charisma, glossolalia. It is the same fire that appeared to Moses, now democratized—no longer confined to prophets and kings, but poured out on "all flesh" (Acts 2:17, quoting Joel 2:28).

### 3. Archangels of Fire

#### Michael: Ruler of Solar Fire

**[[Michael]]** (מיכאל, "Who is like God?") is the **Archangel of Fire** in the Golden Dawn and Western ceremonial magic traditions. Gustav Davidson cites him as the **"Ruler of Solar Fire."**

**In the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram ([[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram|LBRP]]):**
- Michael is invoked at the **South** (the quarter of Fire, Summer, Noon)
- He appears as a towering figure in **red robes**, wielding a **flaming sword**
- His color is **red** (passion, heat, blood, Mars)
- His element is **Fire** (transformative, purifying, consuming)

Michael's fire is **solar**—the fire of the **Sun** ([[Tiphareth]]), the central light that gives life. But he is also **warrior fire**—the dragon-slayer (Revelation 12:7), the defender who wields flame as a weapon against corruption.

**Dual nature of Michael's fire:**
1. **Life-giving** — The Sun that sustains all creation
2. **Death-dealing** — The sword that cuts down the dragon

This duality reflects the essential ambiguity of fire: it cooks food and burns cities; it warms the hearth and razes the forest; it illuminates and blinds.

#### Uriel: Fire of God

**[[Uriel]]** (אוריאל, "Fire of God" or "Light of God") is often called the **"Regent of the Sun"** (Davidson). He is associated with:
- **Fire** — His name literally means "God is my light/fire"
- **The Sun** — Solar illumination, intellectual clarity
- **Thunder and terror** — The destructive aspect of fire (lightning, wildfire)

Uriel appears in the **Apocrypha** (1 Enoch, 2 Esdras) as the angel who:
- **Guides Enoch** through the heavenly realms
- **Reveals secrets** of cosmology and judgment to Ezra
- **Presides over Tartarus** (the abyss where fallen angels are imprisoned)

In Jewish mystical tradition, Uriel is sometimes placed at the **North** (the quarter of mystery, cold fire, the hidden sun below the earth). But in other systems, he shares the **South** with Michael, or rules the **East** (dawn, the rising sun).

**Uriel's fire is intellectual**—the light of **gnosis**, the flame of **understanding**. He burns away ignorance, illuminates hidden truths, and reveals the structure of reality. His fire is not emotional (like Michael's solar passion) but **cognitive**—the Promethean flame of enlightenment.

#### Nathaniel: Lord Over Fire

**Nathaniel** (Nathanel) is specifically listed by Gustav Davidson as the **"angel of fire"** or **"lord over fire."**

**Biblical reference**: Nathaniel saved the **seven men** from the fire in the contest with the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18:20-40, though the text does not name an angel explicitly—this is apocryphal/midrashic attribution). He also burned the servants of Jair (2 Kings 1:9-12, where Elijah calls down fire from heaven).

Nathaniel represents **miraculous fire**—fire that appears and disappears at divine command, fire that **obeys the word of the prophet**, fire as **demonstration of God's power** over nature and false gods.

---

### 4. Ishim/Ashim: Souls of Fire

The **[[Ishim]]** (אישים, "Men" or "Personages") or **Ashim** (אשים, "Flames," "Souls of Fire") are the **tenth angelic order** in the Qabalistic hierarchy, associated with [[Malkuth]] (the Kingdom, Earth).

**Psalm 104:4** is cited as their scriptural foundation:

> *"Who maketh his Angels Spirits and his Ministers a flaming Fire."*

Robert Wang calls them the **"Flames of Fire,"** emphasizing their dual nature:
- **Human origin** — *Ishim* derives from *ish* (אִישׁ, "man"), suggesting sanctified humanity
- **Spiritual function** — *Ashim* derives from *esh* (אֵשׁ, "fire"), suggesting purifying flames

Gustav Davidson notes they are "**composed of fire and snow**"—the paradoxical union of opposites. Fire = spirit, active principle, ascent; snow = matter, passive principle, crystallization. The Ishim hold these opposites in balance within [[Malkuth]], proving that **matter can be spiritualized** and **spirit can be embodied** without either being destroyed.

### 5. Elemental Fire Symbolism

#### Purification and Judgment

Fire represents **testing and refining**. **Malachi 3:2-3** describes the coming of the Lord:

> *"But who can endure the day of his coming? Who can stand when he appears? For he will be like a refiner's fire or a launderer's soap. He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver."*

The **refiner's fire** burns at precise temperature—hot enough to melt the metal and separate dross (impurities), but not so hot as to destroy the gold. The refiner watches the molten metal until he can **see his own reflection** in it—then it is pure.

**Spiritually**: God's purifying fire burns away sin, ego-attachment, and false identity until the soul becomes a **mirror** reflecting the divine image. This is painful but necessary—the soul cannot ascend carrying the weight of shadow.

#### Divine Presence: The Ascending Flame

The **Zohar** (foundational Qabalistic text) describes the **"ascending flame"** as having **two lights**:

1. **White light** (upper flame) — [[Chesed]] (Mercy), steady and continuous, the sustaining fire
2. **Blue-black light** (lower flame) — [[Geburah]] (Judgment), flickering and consuming, the purifying fire

The Zohar teaches:

> "The holy fire ([[Shekinah]]) consumes the lower angels of judgment."

This is the paradox of fire: **fire consuming fire**. The higher, purer flame (white = mercy) consumes the lower, harsher flame (blue-black = severity). Judgment is purified by love; severity is tempered by compassion.

The blue flame at the base of the candle is **hotter** than the yellow flame above—it burns with greater intensity but cannot sustain itself alone. It must be fed by the wick (matter) and crowned by the yellow flame (illumination). This is the alchemical principle: **solve et coagula**—dissolve (blue fire) and coagulate (yellow light).

#### Angelic Composition: Fire and Water

Davidson notes that angels are fundamentally **composed of "fire and snow"** or **"fire and water"**—representing the **reconciliation of opposites** (Mercy and Severity, active and passive, spirit and matter) within their nature.

This is not contradiction but **paradox**—the simultaneous truth of opposing principles. Angels are **fire** (spiritual, immaterial, active, ascending) and **water/snow** (adaptable, flowing, receptive, descending). They are the **mediators** precisely because they hold both poles in unity.

## Ritual Use of Fire in Angelic Invocation

### The Altar Flame

In ceremonial magic, a **candle flame** on the altar represents:
- **The divine presence** descending into the ritual space
- **The aspirant's will** ascending toward the divine
- **The mediating angel** (the flame itself as angelic presence)

The act of **lighting the candle** is an invocation—calling the Angels of Fire to attend the working.

### The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP)

When invoking **[[Michael]]** at the South:

1. **Face South** (the quarter of Fire, Summer, Noon)
2. **Visualize** Michael as a towering figure in red robes, wielding a flaming sword
3. **Speak**: *"Before me Raphael, behind me Gabriel, on my right hand Michael, on my left hand Uriel."*
4. **See** Michael's flaming sword cutting a barrier of fire around the ritual space, protecting from adverse forces

The fire here is **protective and purifying**—it creates sacred space by burning away psychic debris and establishing a boundary the profane cannot cross.

### Fire Offerings

In ancient practice (and some modern ceremonial magic), **fire offerings** (incense, herbs, written petitions burned) are used to:
- **Transmute matter into spirit** — The physical substance becomes smoke, ascending to the heavens
- **Carry prayers upward** — The smoke is the vehicle for intention
- **Feed the Angels of Fire** — Fire consumes the offering, and the angels receive the spiritual essence

**Caution**: Literal fire magic must be practiced safely. Symbolic/visualization fire is safer for most practitioners.
