## Overview

**Lucifer** (Latin: *Lux Ferre*, "Light-Bearer"; Hebrew: *Helel ben Shachar*, הילל בן שחר, "Shining One, Son of Dawn") is the most enigmatic figure in angelology—the **Fallen Seraph**, the **Morning Star** who fell from heaven, the **Shadow of the Divine** made manifest.

In Christian tradition, Lucifer is identified with **Satan**, the adversary, the tempter, the prince of demons. In esoteric traditions, Lucifer represents the **shadow of Kether**, the **inverse of divine light**—not evil in essence, but the **necessary opposition** that allows for free will, individuation, and the drama of consciousness.
