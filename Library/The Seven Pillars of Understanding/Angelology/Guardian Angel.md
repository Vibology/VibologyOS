## Overview

The **Guardian Angel** is a theological and mystical concept found across multiple traditions: the belief that each human soul is assigned a **personal angelic protector** who guides, guards, and intercedes on behalf of the individual throughout life.

In Christian tradition, guardian angels are understood as **Angels** (ninth order) assigned to specific persons. In Jewish mysticism, they are **maggidim** (revealers) or protective spirits. In Islamic tradition, the **Kiraman Katibin** (noble scribes) record deeds and offer protection.
