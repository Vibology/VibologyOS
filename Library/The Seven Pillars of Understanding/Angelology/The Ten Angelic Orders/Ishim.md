## Overview

**Ishim** (Hebrew: אישים, "Souls of Fire," "Flames," or "Men of Fire"; also spelled **Ashim**, אשים) is the **tenth angelic order** in the Qabalistic hierarchy, associated with **[[Malkuth]]** (Kingdom), the tenth Sephirah on the Tree of Life.

This order represents the angels **closest to embodied humanity**—the "Souls of the Just made Perfect" (Wang, p. 115), those who have completed the journey of earthly incarnation and achieved angelic status, or who serve as the spiritual foundation of the material world.

The name *Ishim* derives from *ish* (אִישׁ, "man" or "person"), suggesting **sanctified humanity**—beings who bridge the gap between human and angelic consciousness. In Jewish mystical tradition, the Ishim are sometimes identified with the prophets, patriarchs, and righteous souls who have been elevated to angelic status.

Wang notes that the Ishim/Ashim are the angelic choir of Malkuth, representing the completion of the divine emanation into physical form (Wang, p. 115, 266). Davidson notes that the Ishim are "composed of fire and snow" and serve as the angels most accessible to human perception and invocation (Davidson, p. 156).

**Note on the Tenth Order:** The Christian Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchy ends at nine orders (Angels/Yesod). The Qabalistic/Golden Dawn system extends to ten orders, adding Ishim/Ashim for Malkuth—completing the correspondence between the angelic hierarchy and the ten Sephiroth.
