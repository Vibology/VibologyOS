# Ishim
*Souls of Fire — The Tenth Angelic Order (Malkuth)*

---

## Essence

The **Ishim** (Hebrew: אישים, "Men" or "Personages"; also **Ashim**, אשים, "Flames" or "Souls of Fire") are the **tenth and lowest angelic order** in the Qabalistic hierarchy, associated with **[[Malkuth]]** (Kingdom), the tenth Sephirah on the Tree of Life. They represent the **completion of the divine emanation** into physical form—the angels who stand at the threshold between spirit and matter, mediating between the purely angelic orders above and embodied humanity below.

Unlike the nine Dionysian orders, which descend from pure spirit toward material creation, the Ishim occupy a unique position: they are **sanctified humanity elevated to angelic status**—the "beautiful souls of just men" (Davidson), the prophets and righteous ones who have completed the journey of earthly incarnation and now serve as spiritual foundations of the material world. Robert Wang calls them the "Order of Blessed Souls" or "Souls of the Just made Perfect" (Wang, p. 115).

The name *Ishim* derives from **ish** (אִישׁ, "man" or "person"), suggesting **humanity transfigured**—beings who have bridged the gap between human and angelic consciousness through spiritual attainment. This is the only angelic order whose name explicitly references human nature, marking them as the meeting point where the ladder of Jacob touches earth.

Gustav Davidson notes that the Ishim are "composed of **fire and snow**" (Davidson, p. 156)—the paradoxical union of opposites that characterizes the material world, where spirit descends into form and form is simultaneously consumed by spirit. They reside in the **Fifth Heaven** according to Jewish cosmology, yet their function operates within **Malkuth**, the sphere of Earth, where they manifest as the spiritual power acting within physical reality.

### The Dual Etymology

The tension between **Ishim** and **Ashim** is not a scribal error but a **theological paradox**:

- **Ishim** (אישים) — "Men, Personages": Emphasizes the **human origin** of this order. These are not angels created purely of spirit, but **righteous souls elevated to angelic status**—patriarchs, prophets, saints who have completed the human journey and now serve as angelic ministers. Maimonides identifies them as the angels **who speak to the prophets** and through whom **visions are mediated** to the human intellect (Maimonides, *Mishneh Torah*, Yesodei ha-Torah 2:7).

- **Ashim** (אשים) — "Flames, Souls of Fire": Emphasizes their **spiritual function** within Malkuth. Robert Wang references Psalm 104:4—"Who maketh his Angels Spirits and his Ministers a flaming Fire"—to describe their nature as **purifying flames** that burn within the material world (Wang, p. 115). They are the fire that animates matter, the spiritual essence within physical form.

This dual naming reveals the **fundamental mystery of Malkuth**: spirit descends into matter without losing its divine nature. The Ishim are **men become flames**, humanity transfigured through spiritual attainment into bearers of divine light within the Kingdom.

### Composition: Fire and Snow

Gustav Davidson notes that the Ishim are "composed of **fire and snow**" (Davidson, p. 156)—a striking image drawn from Jewish mystical tradition. This is not poetic decoration but **ontological description**:

- **Fire** represents the **active, spiritual principle**—the ascending impulse, the soul's yearning for God, the purifying flame of consciousness.
- **Snow** represents the **passive, material principle**—the descending crystallization of spirit into form, the coolness of manifestation, the stillness of embodiment.

The Ishim hold these opposites in balance. They are the order that proves **matter can be spiritualized** and **spirit can be embodied** without either principle being annihilated. This is the great work of Malkuth: not the escape from materiality (which would be Gnostic dualism), but the **redemption of matter through conscious presence**.

In Jungian terms, the Ishim represent the **integration of opposites**—the coniunctio oppositorum, the sacred marriage of spirit and flesh that produces the **individuated Self**. They are living proof that the goal of spiritual work is not to abandon the body, but to **illuminate it from within**.

## Theological Depth

### The Tenth Order: Qabalistic Completion

Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite's *Celestial Hierarchy* (5th century) established the standard Christian angelology of **nine orders** arranged in three triads, ending with the order of [[Angels]] associated with [[Yesod]] (Foundation). This nine-fold structure corresponds to the first nine Sephiroth on the Tree of Life.

The **Qabalistic and Jewish mystical traditions** extend the hierarchy to **ten orders** to complete the correspondence with the **Ten Sephiroth**. The Ishim are the **tenth order**, added to fill the final Sephirah—[[Malkuth]]. This is not an innovation but a **restoration of the pattern**: the Tree of Life is ten-fold by nature, and the angelic hierarchy must reflect this completeness (Davidson, p. 156; Wang, p. 266).

Dionysus's nine-fold system reflects the **Christian emphasis on transcendence**—the angels as mediators *above* humanity, drawing souls upward toward God. The Qabalistic ten-fold system includes **immanence**—God's presence *within* the material world. The Ishim represent this immanent dimension: they are not above us, calling us upward, but *among us*, demonstrating that **the Kingdom of Heaven is here**, in Malkuth, when perceived rightly.

### Maimonides' Hierarchy

In the **Mishneh Torah** (*Yesodei ha-Torah* 2:7), Maimonides lists the Ishim as the **tenth and lowest class** of angels—the order **closest to humanity**, through whom **prophetic visions are mediated**. He writes:

> "The tenth rank is the Ishim, and these are the angels who speak to the prophets and appear to them in prophetic visions."

This is their defining function: **prophetic mediation**. The Ishim are the interface between the human intellect and the divine realm. When a prophet receives a vision—when Moses sees the burning bush, or Ezekiel beholds the Merkabah, or Isaiah witnesses the throne room—it is through the **ministry of the Ishim** that these visions are formed and transmitted.

They do not speak *instead of* God (which would be mediumship), nor do they speak *about* God (which would be commentary). They **make God's communication intelligible** to the human mind by translating infinite divine light into symbolic images, narratives, and words that consciousness can receive without being annihilated.

This is a subtle but crucial theological point: **prophecy is not direct divine dictation**. It is a **collaborative act** between the human soul (which must be prepared, purified, and receptive) and the angelic mediators (the Ishim) who shape the transmission according to the prophet's cultural and psychological framework. The message is divine, but the *form* it takes is mediated through the Ishim.

### Souls of the Just Made Perfect

Robert Wang identifies the Ishim as the "**Souls of the Just made Perfect**" (Wang, p. 115), referencing Hebrews 12:22-23:

> "But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly, to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, to the **spirits of the righteous made perfect**."

This passage suggests a **dynamic relationship between humanity and angelhood**. The Ishim are not a separate species created ex nihilo, but the **culmination of human spiritual evolution**—righteous souls who have completed the work of incarnation and now serve as angelic ministers within Malkuth.

Jewish tradition names specific figures elevated to this status:
- **Enoch**, who "walked with God" and was transformed into the Archangel [[Metatron]]
- **Elijah**, taken up in a chariot of fire without tasting death
- The **Patriarchs** (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob)
- The **Prophets** (Moses, Isaiah, Ezekiel)
- The **Righteous** (Tzaddikim) of every generation

The Ishim, then, are not distant cosmic entities but **exemplars of human potential**—proof that the soul can be refined through spiritual practice, moral excellence, and devotional surrender until it becomes a **vessel for divine light** indistinguishable from the angels created at the beginning of time.

This has profound implications: **we are not praying to alien intelligences, but to our own future**. The gap between human and angel is not ontological but developmental. The Ishim demonstrate that consciousness itself is the ladder between heaven and earth.

### Heywood's Traditional Witness (1635)

The 1635 English text *The Hierarchie of the Blessed Angels* by Thomas Heywood provides traditional Christian-Qabalistic synthesis. While Heywood primarily follows the Dionysian nine-fold structure, later Qabalistic commentators (including the [[The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) extended his framework to include the Ishim as the tenth order, completing the Tree.

Heywood's work emphasizes the **gradation of illumination** flowing downward through the orders. The Ishim, as the lowest and final recipients of this cascading light, function as the **final transformers** that step down divine voltage into a frequency the material world can receive without burning. They are, in electrical terms, the **ground wire** of heaven—channeling spiritual current safely into Earth.
