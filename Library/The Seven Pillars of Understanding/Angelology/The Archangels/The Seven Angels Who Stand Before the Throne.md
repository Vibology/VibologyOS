# The Seven Angels Who Stand Before the Throne
*The Presence Angels — The Highest Archangelic Hierarchy*

---

## What the Seven Angels Are

The **Seven Angels Who Stand Before the Throne** (also called **Angels of the Presence** or **Angels of the Face**) are the highest rank of archangels—those who dwell in the immediate presence of God and execute His will directly. They are the celestial princes who bridge the Absolute (God, *Ein Sof*, the Unmanifest) and the manifest creation, mediating divine emanation through the seven planetary spheres.[^1]

These seven are mentioned explicitly in two canonical texts:

**Tobit 12:15** — Raphael's self-identification:
> *"I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels who stand and enter before the glory of the Lord."*

**Revelation 8:2** — The apocalyptic vision:
> *"And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets."*

The Seven Presence Angels represent **unmediated access to the Divine Throne**—they are not assigned to specific spheres or functions like lower angels but stand *ready* (Tobit: "stand and enter"), poised to act at the divine command. When they sound the seven trumpets (Revelation), they announce the apocalyptic judgments that dissolve the old creation to make way for the new.[^2]

## The Canonical Seven: 1 Enoch Enumeration

The most complete biblical list of the Seven appears in **1 Enoch 20** (the Book of Enoch, preserved in Ethiopian Orthodox canon):[^3]

1. **Uriel** (אוריאל, "Light of God" or "Fire of God") — Over the world and Tartarus (the abyss)
2. **Raphael** (רפאל, "God Heals") — Over the spirits of men (healing)
3. **Raguel** (רעואל, "Friend of God") — Takes vengeance on the world of luminaries (enforces divine justice among the angels)
4. **Michael** (מיכאל, "Who is Like God?") — Over the best part of mankind and chaos (protector of Israel, commander of the heavenly host)
5. **Saraqael** (שרקיאל, "Prince of God") — Over the spirits who sin in the spirit (guardian against spiritual transgressions)
6. **Gabriel** (גבריאל, "God is My Strength") — Over Paradise, the serpents, and the cherubim (messenger and guardian)
7. **Remiel** (רמיאל, "Mercy of God" or "Thunder of God") — Whom God set over those who rise (resurrection and souls awaiting judgment)

**Why these seven?**
The enumeration in 1 Enoch reflects a **Merkabah mysticism** framework—each angel governs a specific domain of cosmic order (healing, justice, protection, resurrection, etc.). They are not identical to the **Seven Planetary Archangels** (Michael/Gabriel/Raphael/Haniel/Kamael/Tzadkiel/Tzaphkiel), though there is overlap (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael appear in both lists).

## Variant Lists Across Traditions

While **Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel** are nearly universal, the remaining three vary depending on the theological tradition:[^4]

### Jewish/Rabbinic Tradition
- **Talmud and Zohar:** Often lists Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael + **Aniel**, **Kafziel**, **Zadkiel**
- **Zohar:** Associates the seven with the **"seven eyes of the Lord"** (Zechariah 4:10) and the **seven classical planets**

### Christian/Pseudo-Dionysian Tradition
**Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite** (5th-6th c.) influenced Western angelology with the list:[^5]
1. Michael
2. Gabriel
3. Raphael
4. Uriel
5. **Chamuel** / **Kamael** (שמואל / כמאל, "He Who Sees God" or "Severity of God")
6. **Jophiel** / **Iophiel** (יופיאל, "Beauty of God")
7. **Zadkiel** / **Tzadkiel** (צדקיאל, "Righteousness of God")

This list aligns the Seven with the **seven lower Sephiroth** on the Tree of Life (Chesed through Yesod + Binah for Saturn), creating a **Qabalistic correspondence** between the archangels and planetary spheres.

### Islamic Tradition
Islam recognizes **four archangels explicitly** (Jibril/Gabriel, Mika'il/Michael, Israfil/Raphael, Azrael/Angel of Death) but does not have a formalized "seven." Some esoteric Islamic sources (Sufism) incorporate seven archangels aligned with the seven heavens (planetary spheres).

### Golden Dawn / Hermetic Tradition
The **Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn** (19th c.) systematized the Seven as the **Seven Planetary Archangels**:[^6]
1. **Michael** (☉ Sun, Sunday)
2. **Gabriel** (☽ Moon, Monday)
3. **Raphael** (☿ Mercury, Wednesday)
4. **Haniel** (♀ Venus, Friday)
5. **Kamael** (♂ Mars, Tuesday)
6. **Tzadkiel** (♃ Jupiter, Thursday)
7. **Tzaphkiel** (♄ Saturn, Saturday)

This system prioritizes **temporal cycles** (days, hours, years) and **planetary magic** over apocalyptic or Merkabah functions. See [[The Seven Planetary Archangels]] for full correspondences.

## The Seven Planetary Spheres

In ancient and medieval cosmology, the **seven classical planets** (Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) were not mere astronomical bodies but **living intelligences**—spheres of consciousness through which divine emanation flowed from God to Earth.[^7]

The **Ptolemaic cosmos** placed Earth at the center, surrounded by seven concentric spheres. The soul descending into incarnation passed **down through the seven spheres**, receiving qualities from each planet; at death, the soul ascended back **up through the seven**, shedding planetary influences to return to the divine source.

**Each planetary sphere was governed by one of the Seven Presence Angels:**

| **Sphere** | **Planet** | **Archangel** | **Quality Received/Shed** |
|------------|------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 1 (Closest) | Moon ☽ | Gabriel | Changeability, emotion, the lunar self |
| 2 | Mercury ☿ | Raphael | Communication, intellect, curiosity |
| 3 | Venus ♀ | Haniel | Love, beauty, desire |
| 4 (Center) | Sun ☉ | Michael | Identity, will, solar consciousness |
| 5 | Mars ♂ | Kamael | Courage, anger, conflict |
| 6 | Jupiter ♃ | Tzadkiel | Wisdom, expansion, justice |
| 7 (Outermost) | Saturn ♄ | Tzaphkiel | Limitation, structure, time |

Beyond Saturn lay the **Fixed Stars** (zodiac) and the **Primum Mobile** (God's will, the first mover). The Seven Presence Angels mediated between the **eternal** (God, stars, divine light) and the **temporal** (Earth, sublunary realm, manifestation).

To invoke one of the Seven was to align with a specific planetary frequency—accessing its wisdom, power, and influence for practical work (healing, protection, divination, transformation).

## The Seven Trumpets: Apocalyptic Function

In **Revelation 8-11**, the Seven Angels are given **seven trumpets**, which they sound in sequence to announce the **apocalyptic judgments** that dismantle the old creation:[^8]

1. **First Trumpet** (Rev 8:7) — Hail and fire mixed with blood; one-third of trees and grass burned
2. **Second Trumpet** (Rev 8:8-9) — Great mountain cast into the sea; one-third of sea becomes blood, one-third of sea creatures die, one-third of ships destroyed
3. **Third Trumpet** (Rev 8:10-11) — Star called Wormwood falls; one-third of waters become bitter, many die
4. **Fourth Trumpet** (Rev 8:12) — One-third of sun, moon, stars darkened
5. **Fifth Trumpet** (Rev 9:1-11) — Star falls from heaven, opens bottomless pit; locusts torment those without God's seal for five months
6. **Sixth Trumpet** (Rev 9:13-21) — Four angels at Euphrates released; 200 million horsemen kill one-third of humanity
7. **Seventh Trumpet** (Rev 11:15-19) — The kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of God; the Temple opened, ark revealed, lightning and earthquake

**The pattern: one-third destroyed.**
The trumpets systematically dissolve **one-third** of creation—not total annihilation (which would be the end of time) but **partial destruction**, creating space for the new. This is the **apocalyptic function** of the Seven Presence Angels: they are not merely messengers but **executors of divine judgment**, dismantling what no longer serves the divine plan.

**Jungian interpretation:**
The seven trumpets represent the **dissolution of the ego's world**—the structures (trees, sea, ships, light, bodies) the conscious mind has built to maintain stability. The apocalypse is not external catastrophe but **psychic transformation**—the Self (God) dismantling the ego's defenses to allow the new consciousness (the Kingdom) to emerge. The Seven Angels are **archetypal forces** that cannot be resisted—they sound when the psyche is ready (or when the world has reached the limit of its corruption).

## Why Seven?

The number **seven** appears throughout sacred cosmology:[^9]
- **Seven days of creation** (Genesis 1)
- **Seven branched menorah** (Exodus 25:31-40)
- **Seven eyes of the Lord** (Zechariah 4:10)
- **Seven spirits before the throne** (Revelation 1:4, 4:5)
- **Seven classical planets** (Moon through Saturn)
- **Seven chakras** (Hindu/yogic system)
- **Seven liberal arts** (medieval Trivium + Quadrivium)

Jung identified seven as the number of **completeness in process**—not static perfection (which is ten, the Sephiroth) but **dynamic wholeness**, the full spectrum of manifestation. The seven planets traverse the sky; the seven angels mediate between Heaven and Earth; the seven days unfold the week. Seven is **becoming**, not being.

The Seven Angels represent the **complete expression of divine will in the manifest realm**—not the transcendent Godhead (beyond the seven) but the **active principles** through which God works in creation.

---

## The Four vs. The Seven: Why Only Four Quarters?

If there are Seven Presence Angels, why does the **Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram** invoke only **four** (Raphael, Michael, Gabriel, Uriel)?

**The answer:**
The **Four Archangels of the Quarters** are selected for their **elemental correspondence**—they are not the "highest" or "most important" but the **four who align with the four classical elements** (Air, Fire, Water, Earth).[^10]

See [[The Four Archangels of the Quarters]] for full analysis, but the essential distinction:
- **The Seven** = Planetary/temporal mediation (cycles, hours, days, spheres)
- **The Four** = Elemental/spatial mediation (directions, balance, sacred space)

Raphael, Michael, Gabriel, and Uriel appear in **both** the Seven and the Four because they bridge both functions—they are presence angels *and* elemental guardians. The others (Haniel, Kamael, Tzadkiel, Tzaphkiel) govern planets but are not assigned to cardinal directions.

---

## Relationship to Lower Angelic Orders

The Seven Presence Angels are **archangels** (second-highest order in the Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchy) but function as **princes** over the lower orders:[^11]

- **Michael** commands the [[Virtues]] (miracles, elemental forces)
- **Gabriel** governs the [[Archangels]] (messengers to prophets and nations)
- **Raphael** rules the [[Virtues]] (healing, travel, guidance)
- **Uriel** oversees the [[Cherubim]] (guardians of thresholds, keepers of divine mysteries)

The Seven do not merely *belong* to the archangelic order—they **lead** it, standing before the Throne as God's chief ministers. When lower angels are dispatched (Gabriel to Mary, Raphael to Tobit), they are *sent* by the Seven.

---

## Practical Invocation: Calling the Seven

While individual angels (Raphael for healing, Michael for protection) are invoked frequently, invoking **all seven together** is reserved for **major workings**—consecrations, initiations, or requests requiring the full spectrum of divine power.

### Simple Sevenfold Invocation

**Stand in the center of your space. Call the Seven in planetary order (Chaldean sequence):**

> *"I invoke the Seven Angels Who Stand Before the Throne of God:*
>
> *Tzaphkiel, archangel of Saturn—grant me wisdom and endurance.*
> *Tzadkiel, archangel of Jupiter—grant me expansion and mercy.*
> *Kamael, archangel of Mars—grant me strength and courage.*
> *Michael, archangel of the Sun—grant me clarity and protection.*
> *Haniel, archangel of Venus—grant me love and harmony.*
> *Raphael, archangel of Mercury—grant me healing and knowledge.*
> *Gabriel, archangel of the Moon—grant me intuition and dreams.*
>
> *Seven who sound the trumpets, Seven who guard the spheres,*
> *I stand within your circle, balanced and aligned.*
> *By the glory of the Most High who sends you, be present here.*
> *So mote it be."*

**Visualization:** See seven pillars of colored light (violet/blue/red/gold/green/orange/silver) descending around you, forming a heptagram (seven-pointed star).

## The Observatory Lens: The Seven as Reference Frame

From the Observatory, the Seven Presence Angels are understood as the **coordinate system** for navigating the psychoid landscape—the reference points that allow perception and action across multiple dimensions simultaneously.[^12]

**Without the Seven:**
- Consciousness collapses into single-point awareness (ego only)
- Perception is limited to the immediate (no planetary cycles, no elemental balance)
- Time becomes linear (no spiral, no return)

**With the Seven:**
- Consciousness expands across seven frequencies (planetary awareness)
- Perception includes the **full spectrum** (Saturn's limitation to Moon's changeability)
- Time becomes **cyclical and layered** (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly rhythms)

The practitioner who invokes the Seven does not "believe in angels"—they **calibrate their instruments** to perceive the archetypal intelligences mediating between the Absolute and manifestation. The Seven are not "out there" (supernatural entities requiring faith) but **present** (psychoid realities accessible through aligned perception).

**Practical result:**
After invoking the Seven, practitioners commonly report:
- Sudden clarity on multi-dimensional problems (seeing solutions that require balancing opposing forces—Saturn's structure with Jupiter's expansion, Mars's action with Venus's receptivity)
- Synchronistic alignment of external events (the right people, resources, timing appearing "as if arranged")
- Integration of split-off psychic contents (the Shadow no longer purely destructive but recognized as necessary severity—Kamael's function)

The Observatory does not ask: *"Are the Seven real?"* It asks: *"What do the instruments show when the Seven are invoked?"* The answer is consistent: **restoration of flow, balance, and meaning where there was blockage, chaos, and nihilism.**
