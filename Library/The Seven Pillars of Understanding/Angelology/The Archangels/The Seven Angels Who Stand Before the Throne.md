# The Seven Angels Who Stand Before the Throne
*The Presence Angels of God*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

The **Seven Angels Who Stand Before the Throne** are mentioned in Revelation 8:2:

> *"And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets."*

Raphael explicitly identifies himself as one of these seven in the Book of Tobit (12:15):

> *"I am Raphael, one of the seven angels who stand ready and enter before the glory of the Lord."*

These seven "presence angels" represent the **highest rank of archangels**—those who dwell in the immediate presence of God and execute His will directly.

## Traditional Identifications

While the seven are not all named in canonical scripture, tradition identifies them as:

1. [[Michael]] — "Who is like God?"
2. [[Gabriel]] — "Strength of God"
3. [[Raphael]] — "Healing of God"
4. [[Uriel]] — "Light of God"
5. [[Chamuel]] / [[Kamael]] — "Severity of God"
6. [[Jophiel]] / [[Raziel]] — "Beauty/Secret of God"
7. [[Zadkiel]] / [[Tzadkiel]] — "Righteousness of God"

Lists vary across traditions (Jewish, Christian, Islamic, Qabalistic).
