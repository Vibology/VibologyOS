# Samael
*The Severity of God — Angel of Death and Adversary*

## Overview

**Samael** (Hebrew: סמאל, "Venom of God" or "Poison of God") is one of the most complex and ambiguous figures in Jewish angelology—simultaneously an **archangel of severity**, an **angel of death**, and in some traditions, the **adversary** (Satan). His nature defies simple categorization as either "good" or "evil."

In Qabalistic tradition, Samael is sometimes associated with **[[Geburah]]** (Severity), serving as the executor of divine judgment. In this role, he is not evil but necessary—the surgeon's scalpel that cuts away what must be removed, the severity that balances mercy. However, when unbalanced, Samael becomes the **accuser** and **destroyer**.

Davidson notes that Samael is "the chief of the Satans" in some texts, yet also "the angel of death who brings the kiss of death to the righteous" (Davidson, p. 255-257). This paradox reflects the dual nature of severity itself.

## The Dual Nature

**As Archangel of Geburah:**
- Executor of divine justice
- Necessary severity in service of cosmic order
- The strength to say "no" and set boundaries

**As Adversary/Fallen:**
- The accuser who tests souls
- Death as the final boundary
- Severity divorced from mercy (shadow)
