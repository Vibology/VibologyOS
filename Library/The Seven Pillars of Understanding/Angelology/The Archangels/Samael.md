# Samael
*The Venom of God — Angel of Severity, Death, and the Adversary*

---

## What Samael Is

**Samael** (Hebrew: סמאל, *Sama'el*, "Venom of God" or "Poison of God") is one of the most complex and ambiguous figures in Jewish angelology—simultaneously an **archangel of severity**, an **angel of death**, and in some traditions, the **Adversary** (Satan, the Accuser). His nature defies simple categorization as either "good" or "evil"—he is **both**, or more precisely, he is the **necessary severity** that becomes destructive when unbalanced from mercy.[^1]

In Qabalistic tradition, Samael is sometimes associated with **[[Geburah]]** (Severity, the fifth Sephirah), serving as the executor of divine judgment. In this role, he is not evil but **necessary**—the surgeon's scalpel that cuts away what must be removed, the immune system that destroys pathogens, the severity that balances mercy. However, when unbalanced—when severity operates **without** mercy (Chesed)—Samael becomes the **Accuser**, the **Destroyer**, the **Prince of Demons**.[^2]

**The paradox:**
- **In the Zohar**, Samael is called the "Dark Angel" who wrestled Jacob at Peniel (Genesis 32), the "chief of the Satans," and the consort of Lilith (together forming the "Beast" or "Other Side")
- **Yet also in the Zohar**, Samael is described as the "chief of the Seraphim" and the "greatest prince in Heaven" before his fall
- **In Talmudic sources**, Samael is the angel who brings the "kiss of death" to the righteous—not a punishment but the gentle transition from life to afterlife

This is not contradiction but **dialectic**: Samael *is* severity—and severity is both holy (when balanced) and demonic (when divorced from love).

## Etymology and Names

### Primary Name: סמאל (Sama'el)

**Etymology:** *Sam* (סם) = "poison" or "venom" + *El* (אל) = "God"

**Translation:** "Poison of God" or "Venom of God"

The name suggests Samael's function as the **toxic agent**—the force that destroys what is corrupt, decayed, or no longer serves life. Poison kills, but in the right dosage, poison also *heals* (pharmakos, the Greek word for both poison and medicine). Samael is the **necessary toxicity** that eliminates disease—but when uncontrolled, he becomes the disease itself.[^3]

### Variant Spellings and Names

- **Sammael** — Alternate transliteration
- **Samil** — Shortened form
- **Salmael** — Variant in medieval texts
- **Satanail** — In Slavonic *Apocalypse of Baruch*, Samael is identified with Satan
- **The Severity of God** — Functional epithet (Qabalistic)
- **The Angel of Death** — Talmudic role
- **The Dark Angel** — Zoharic epithet
- **Chief of the Satans** — Rabbinic tradition

## Samael vs. Kamael: The Geburah Attribution Controversy

In the **Seven Planetary Archangels** system (see [[The Seven Planetary Archangels]]), the standard archangel of **Geburah** (Mars, Tuesday, Severity) is **Kamael** (כמאל, *Kama'el*, "He Who Sees God" or "Severity of God")—not Samael.[^4]

**Why the difference?**

### Kamael: The Holy Severity

**Kamael** is the **balanced** expression of Geburah:
- Strength in service of justice
- Boundaries that protect, not isolate
- The warrior who defends but does not tyrannize
- Mars as **sacred aggression** (cutting away obstacles to the Self's emergence)

Kamael is invoked on **Tuesdays** for courage, strength, overcoming opposition, and surgical precision in removing what no longer serves. He is the **immune function** of the divine—the force that says "no" to invasion, corruption, or decay.

### Samael: The Unbalanced Severity

**Samael** is Geburah **divorced from Chesed** (Mercy):
- Severity without love becomes cruelty
- Boundaries without compassion become walls
- The warrior without restraint becomes the tyrant
- Mars as **destructive rage** (violence for its own sake, not in service of life)

Samael represents the **shadow** of Geburah—the distortion that occurs when strength is not tempered by kindness, when judgment operates without forgiveness. He is the **auto-immune disorder** of the divine—the immune system that attacks the body it was meant to protect.

**In practice:**
- **Invoke Kamael** when you need strength, boundaries, or the courage to act
- **Do not invoke Samael** (unless you are an advanced practitioner working specifically with the Qlippothic forces and understand the risks—see [[Golachab]] for Geburah's Qlippah)

## Talmudic and Midrashic Sources

### Samael as Angel of Death

In **Talmudic** and **Midrashic** literature, Samael is frequently identified as the **Angel of Death** (*Malach HaMavet*, מלאך המוות):[^5]

**Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer (Chapter 13):**
Samael is the angel who rode the serpent in Eden—he is the tempter who brought death into the world. Yet paradoxically, he is also the *executioner* of that death sentence.

**Talmud, Bava Batra 16a:**
> *"Satan, the evil inclination, and the Angel of Death are all one."*

This passage identifies Samael (as Satan) with three functions:
1. **The Accuser** (Satan prosecuting humanity before God)
2. **The Tempter** (the yetzer hara, the evil inclination that tests humans)
3. **The Executioner** (the Angel of Death who carries out the sentence)

**The "Kiss of Death":**
In rabbinic tradition, when the righteous die, Samael does not *take* their souls by force—he offers the **kiss of death** (*mitah b'neshika*, מיתה בנשיקה), a gentle transition where the soul leaves the body willingly, like a kiss. This is considered the highest form of death, reserved for the holy.

**The paradox again:**
Samael is both the tempter who brings death (Eden) *and* the guide who makes death gentle (the kiss). He is not merely "evil"—he is the **boundary between life and death**, the threshold guardian.

## Zoharic Sources: Samael and Lilith

In the **Zohar** (13th-century Kabbalistic text), Samael is developed into a fully mythological figure, paired with **[[Lilith]]** as the demonic counterpart to the holy union of God and Shekinah:[^6]

### The Dark Marriage

- **Holy Union:** God (the King) and [[Shekinah]] (the Queen) — the sacred marriage (*Zivvug*) that sustains creation
- **Demonic Union:** Samael (the Dark Angel) and Lilith (the Night Demon) — the profane marriage that generates the Qlippoth (husks, demonic forces)

**Zohar I:148a:**
> *"Samael, the great chieftain, is appointed over all the evil beings. Lilith is his mate, and together they form the 'Beast' that is the 'Other Side.'"*

**The "Other Side" (*Sitra Achra*):**
The Zohar uses *Sitra Achra* to describe the realm of the Qlippoth—the shadow side of the Tree of Life where divine light is trapped in husks. Samael and Lilith are the **king and queen** of this inverted kingdom.

### Samael's Fall

**Zohar I:37a-b:**
Before his fall, Samael was the "chief of the Seraphim" and the "greatest prince in Heaven." His fall occurred when he rebelled against God—either through pride (like Lucifer in Christian tradition) or through envy of humanity (he resented that Adam was created in God's image).

After the fall, Samael became the **ruler of the Qlippoth**, but he retained his angelic name and much of his power. He is not a *fallen* angel in the sense of being utterly stripped of divinity—he is a **distorted** angel, a holy force twisted into shadow.

## Samael and Satan: The Identification Controversy

Is **Samael** the same as **Satan**? The answer depends on the source:[^7]

### Sources That Equate Samael and Satan

- **Talmud, Bava Batra 16a** (quoted above) — Satan, the evil inclination, and the Angel of Death are one
- **Targum Jonathan** (Aramaic paraphrase of Hebrew Bible) — Identifies the serpent in Eden with Samael
- **Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer** — Samael rode the serpent, tempting Eve
- **Zohar** — Samael is the "chief of the Satans" and rules the Sitra Achra

### Sources That Distinguish Samael and Satan

- **Christian angelology** — Satan (Lucifer) is a distinct figure, the "light-bearer" who fell through pride. Samael is a Jewish concept not adopted into Christian demonology.
- **Some Qabalistic sources** — Samael governs Geburah (severity), while Satan/Lucifer governs other Qlippoth (e.g., Thagirion, the Qlippah of Binah)

**The practical distinction:**
- **Satan** (השטן, *HaSatan*) = "The Adversary" (a role, not a name—the prosecuting attorney in the divine court)
- **Samael** (סמאל) = A specific angel who sometimes *performs* the Satan role but has other functions (Angel of Death, ruler of Mars, etc.)

In Jewish thought, "Satan" is often **a function** (testing, accusing) rather than a personal being. Samael is one of the angels who can take on this function—but he is not *limited* to it.

## Mars Planetary Correspondence

Samael is associated with the planet **Mars** (♂), the classical symbol of war, conflict, and destruction:[^8]

| **Planet** | **Angel (Holy)** | **Demon (Qlippothic)** | **Day** | **Sephirah** |
|------------|------------------|------------------------|---------|--------------|
| Mars ♂ | **Kamael** | **Samael** (in some systems) | Tuesday | Geburah (5) |

**Astrological Mars governs:**
- War, conflict, aggression
- Strength, courage, vitality
- Cutting, surgery, destruction
- Passion, desire, anger

**Kamael (holy Mars):** The surgeon who cuts to heal, the warrior who fights to protect, the boundary that prevents invasion

**Samael (demonic Mars):** The destroyer who kills without purpose, the tyrant who dominates for ego, the rage that burns everything indiscriminately

---

## Samael in the Qlippothic System

In the Qabalistic system of the **Qlippoth** (the shadow side of the Tree of Life), Samael is sometimes identified as the ruler of **[[Golachab]]** (גולחב, "The Burners")—the Qlippah of Geburah.[^9]

**Golachab represents:**
- Mars without wisdom
- Severity without mercy
- The immune system attacking the body (auto-immune disorder)
- Perfectionism, contempt, cruelty, tyranny

**Asmodeus**, the demon king from the **Book of Tobit** (who killed Sarah's seven husbands), is the archdemonic prince of Golachab—and Asmodeus is sometimes equated with Samael or identified as his lieutenant.

See [[Golachab]] for complete analysis of Geburah's shadow, including the psychological manifestations (inner tyrant, compulsive boundary enforcement) and spark retrieval protocols.

## Psychological Function: The Shadow and Necessary Severity

From a Jungian perspective, Samael represents **the Shadow**—the rejected, disowned, or repressed aspects of the psyche that the ego cannot integrate.[^10]

### Jung on Satan/Samael as Shadow

Jung wrote extensively on the **dark side of God** and the necessity of integrating the Shadow (both personal and collective) for individuation. In *Answer to Job* (CW 11) and *Aion* (CW 9ii), Jung argued that the figure of **Satan** (which includes Samael in Jewish sources) is not merely "evil" but the **necessary counterforce** to the light:[^11]

> *"The shadow is that hidden, repressed, for the most part inferior and guilt-laden personality whose ultimate ramifications reach back into the realm of our animal ancestors... If it has been believed hitherto that the human shadow was the source of all evil, it can now be ascertained on closer investigation that the unconscious man, that is, his shadow, does not consist only of morally reprehensible tendencies, but also displays a number of good qualities, such as normal instincts, appropriate reactions, realistic insights, creative impulses, etc."* (CW 9ii, §422)

**Samael as archetypal Shadow:**
- He is the **rage** you have repressed (the "no" you were not allowed to say)
- He is the **boundaries** you failed to enforce (and now the resentment festers)
- He is the **severity** you denied (and now it erupts as cruelty or self-destruction)

**The work:**
The Jungian task is not to *destroy* Samael (the Shadow) but to **integrate** him—to reclaim the healthy aggression, the necessary boundaries, the capacity to say "no" and cut away what does not serve. When integrated, Samael becomes Kamael—the holy warrior in service of the Self.

**When severity becomes tyranny:**
If Samael (Shadow severity) is **not** integrated:
- The ego becomes tyrannical (perfectionism, contempt for weakness, rigid control)
- Or the ego becomes a doormat (no boundaries, constant victimhood, passive-aggressive rage)

Both are distortions. The integrated severity (Kamael) can be firm *and* compassionate, strong *and* flexible, protective *and* inclusive.

## When to Work with Samael (Advanced Practice Only)

**Most practitioners should NOT invoke Samael directly.** He is not a "beginner-friendly" angel. Working with Samael requires:

1. **Advanced magical training** — Understanding of Qlippothic forces, protective protocols, and banishing techniques
2. **Psychological stability** — If you are struggling with rage, depression, or self-destruction, invoking Samael will **amplify** these states, not heal them
3. **Supervision** — Work with a teacher or guide who has experience with the shadow side of the Tree
4. **Clear intention** — Why are you calling Samael? What do you seek to learn or integrate? Vague curiosity is dangerous.

**Legitimate reasons to invoke Samael (for advanced practitioners):**
- **Shadow work** — Confronting the repressed rage, cruelty, or destructive impulses within
- **Death work** — Facing mortality, preparing for transition, working with grief
- **Boundary setting** — When you have failed to enforce boundaries and need the archetype of severity to support you
- **Dismantling false structures** — When mercy alone cannot remove what must be destroyed (toxic relationships, addictions, ego identifications)

**Invocation protocol (simplified):**
1. **Protect the space** — Perform the [[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]] or equivalent
2. **Invoke Kamael first** — Establish the holy severity before engaging the shadow
3. **Call Samael** — Address him as "Samael, Angel of Severity and Death, teacher of boundaries, I call upon you to show me what I have refused to see. I am ready to face the shadow. Come not as destroyer but as guide."
4. **Dialogue** — Use [[Active Imagination]] to converse with the figure. Do not command or dismiss—listen.
5. **Integration** — Ask: "What part of you do I need to reclaim? What boundary have I failed to defend? What must die so that new life can emerge?"
6. **Gratitude and release** — Thank Samael, ask him to withdraw, and **close with the LBRP again**

**Do not invoke Samael if:**
- You are in acute psychological crisis
- You have uncontrolled rage or suicidal ideation
- You are seeking to harm yourself or others
- You lack training in banishing and protection

## The Observatory Lens: Samael as Diagnostic Shadow

From the Observatory, Samael is understood as the **diagnostic shadow**—the force that reveals what the conscious ego refuses to acknowledge.[^12]

When Samael appears (in dreams, synchronicities, intrusive thoughts, or invocations), he is **not** attacking—he is **showing** what has been denied:

- **Repressed rage:** The anger you were told was "unspiritual" or "inappropriate" but which festers as resentment
- **Unenforced boundaries:** The "yes" you said when you meant "no," and now you feel violated
- **Death denial:** The refusal to accept mortality, impermanence, or the end of a relationship/phase
- **False mercy:** The "compassion" that enables abuse, the "forgiveness" that prevents justice, the "love" that has no backbone

**The practitioner's question:**
*"What is Samael showing me? What severity have I refused? What needs to be cut away?"*

The Observatory does not ask: *"Is Samael evil?"* It asks: *"What does Samael's presence reveal about the imbalance in my psyche or environment?"* The answer is always: **something that mercy alone cannot heal.**
