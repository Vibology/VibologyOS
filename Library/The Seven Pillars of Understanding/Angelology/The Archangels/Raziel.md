# Raziel
*The Patron of Shadowhunters*

**Archangel Raziel** (Hebrew: רזיאל, *Razi'el* — "Secret of God" or "Herald of Deity") is the **Prince of Hidden Knowledge**, the **Revealer of Mysteries**, and the **Angel of the Supreme Secrets**. In the Qabalistic tradition, Raziel governs **[[Chokmah]]** (Wisdom, the second [[Sephirah]]), the primal masculine force of creation—the explosive first emanation from the Absolute, the divine spark that initiates all manifestation. Where [[Metatron]] at [[Kether]] represents the Unmanifest Crown, Raziel at Chokmah is the *first intelligible principle*, the Logos, the divine intelligence that structures the cosmos.

Raziel is not a comforting presence. He does not protect in the manner of [[Michael]], nor does he heal like [[Raphael]]. Raziel's function is **revelation**—the unveiling of what has been concealed, the granting of wisdom too vast for mortal comprehension, the opening of the sealed book. To invoke Raziel is to ask for knowledge that may shatter the structures of the ego, for truth that cannot be unlearned.

## Qabalistic Attribution: The Supernal Father

### Chokmah: The First Emanation of Consciousness

In the structure of the [[Tree of Life]], **[[Chokmah]]** is the **Supernal Father**, the masculine potency that emerges from the undifferentiated unity of [[Kether]]. Where Kether is the Crown (the "I AM"), Chokmah is the *first movement*—the explosive outpouring of divine energy, the primal "YES" of existence.

Wang describes Chokmah's attributes in *The Qabalistic Tarot* using titles including "The Great Stimulator," "The Supernal Father," and "The First Positive," describing it as "Dynamic Outpouring Energy, Unorganized and Uncompensated." He links Chokmah to the Logos, noting that "Yah is the Divine Ideal Wisdom."

Raziel, as the archangel of Chokmah, is the intelligence through which this **primal force** becomes *knowable*. He is not the force itself (that is the divine essence) but the **revealer** of its patterns, the one who shows humanity the *mechanics of creation*.

### The Divine Name: Yah (יה)

The divine name of Chokmah is **Yah** (יה), the first two letters of the Tetragrammaton (YHVH). This is the **seed** of the divine name, the spark from which all else unfolds. To invoke Raziel is to stand at the threshold of this primal utterance, to receive the flash of insight before it has been articulated into language or form.

### The Tetragrammaton: Yod (Fire)

In the structure of the Tetragrammaton:
- **Yod (י)** = Chokmah = Fire = Father
- **Heh (ה)** = [[Binah]] = Water = Mother
- **Vav (ו)** = [[Tiphareth]] = Air = Son
- **Heh (ה)** = [[Malkuth]] = Earth = Daughter

Chokmah is the **Yod**, the single point, the initial spark. This is why Raziel's primary element is **Fire**—not the consuming fire of the Seraphim, but the *electric fire* of pure ideation, the lightning bolt of genius.

### The Four Worlds: Raziel in Briah

Raziel governs Chokmah in **Briah** (the World of Creation), the realm where divine ideas first take archetypal form. In this sense, Raziel mediates between the unmanifest (Atziluth/Kether) and the conceptual (Yetzirah/the lower Sephiroth). He is the **archangel of the architects**, the revealer of the divine blueprints.

## The Sefer Raziel HaMalakh: The Book of Mysteries

The most famous myth of Raziel is his gift to Adam of the **Sefer Raziel HaMalakh** (*The Book of the Angel Raziel*), a grimoire containing "1,500 keys to the mystery of the world not revealed even to the holy angels."

### The Myth: Raziel's Gift to Adam

After Adam's expulsion from the Garden of Eden, he sat in despair, grieving the loss of divine intimacy. God, in compassion, sent Raziel to deliver to Adam a book containing the secrets of:
- The structure of the cosmos
- The names of angels and spirits
- The art of healing
- The movements of the stars
- The mysteries of life and death
- The knowledge to foretell future events

The **Zohar** recounts:

> "The angel Raziel is the keeper of all secrets and the 'herald of the deity.' He stands so close to the throne of God that he hears all that is decreed concerning the universe."

### The Theft and Recovery

The lesser angels, envious that such knowledge had been given to a mortal, stole the book and cast it into the sea. God commanded **Rahab** (the Angel of the Deep) to retrieve it. The book was returned to Adam, and from him it passed to:
1. **Seth** (Adam's son, the inheritor of the mysteries)
2. **Enoch** (who may have transcribed it as the *Book of Enoch*)
3. **Noah** (who used its wisdom to build the Ark and survive the Flood)
4. **Solomon** (who derived his legendary wisdom and command over spirits from it)

### Esoteric Interpretation: The Book as Consciousness

The *Sefer Raziel* is not merely a historical grimoire (though medieval texts bearing this name exist). It is a **symbol of the capacity for revelation**—the ability of human consciousness to receive direct gnosis from the supernal realms. The "book" is the **Higher Mind** itself, the Ajna center opened, the third eye activated. To "read the Sefer Raziel" is to access the **Akashic Records**, the imprint of all that has been and will be.

## Raziel in Biblical and Mystical Tradition

### The Zohar: Herald of the Throne

The **Zohar** describes Raziel as standing at the foot of God's throne, proclaiming the secrets decreed by the Divine to all creation. Each day, Raziel stands upon **Mount Horeb** (the mountain of God's revelation to Moses) and announces the mysteries of humanity to all who can hear.

This echoes the function of Chokmah itself: the **broadcast** of divine intelligence into manifestation. Raziel does not hoard knowledge—he *proclaims* it. But only those with "ears to hear" (initiated consciousness) can receive it.

### No Direct Biblical Appearance

Unlike [[Michael]], [[Gabriel]], or [[Raphael]], Raziel does not appear by name in canonical scripture. He is a figure of **esoteric Judaism**—the Kabbalah, the Zohar, the magical texts. This is fitting: Raziel governs *hidden* knowledge, the wisdom transmitted teacher to student, not the exoteric doctrine of the masses.

### Christian Mysticism: The Silent Revealer

In Christian angelology, Raziel is rarely mentioned. **Pseudo-Dionysius** does not list him. However, his function parallels the Christian concept of the **Logos** (John 1:1—"In the beginning was the Word"):

> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made."

Raziel, as the angel of Chokmah, is the *angelic reflection* of the Logos—the divine reason that orders chaos, the pattern-maker, the revealer of the hidden structure.

## Iconography and Symbolism

Raziel is traditionally depicted as:

- **Cloaked in grey or silver light**, as if wrapped in clouds or mist—knowledge veiled, mystery half-revealed
- **Holding a book** (the Sefer Raziel), often sealed or glowing with inner light
- **Wings of many eyes**, echoing the Auphanim/Wheels (Ezekiel's vision of eyes within wheels)
- **Crowned or haloed in stars**, signifying his governance of the Masloth (Zodiac)
- **Radiating soft, diffuse luminosity**—not the blazing solar fire of Michael, but the **moonlit glow of reflected wisdom**

### The Wheel (Auphanim)

Raziel is associated with the **Auphanim** (אופנים), the "Wheels" or "Whirling Forces"—the angelic order of Chokmah. In Ezekiel 1:15-21, the prophet describes wheels "full of eyes all around," moving in perfect synchrony with the Cherubim. This is the nature of Chokmah: the **wheels of cosmic law**, the mechanisms by which divine will unfolds into manifestation.

The "eyes" symbolize **omniscience**—the capacity to see all patterns, all connections, all possibilities simultaneously.

## Function in Divine Economy

Raziel's cosmic function is **revelation of the blueprint**. Where the Seraphim at Kether are pure adoration (love without comprehension), Raziel at Chokmah is the first *knowing*. He mediates between:
- The **Unmanifest** (Kether/Ein Sof) and the **Manifest** (the lower Sephiroth)
- The **Unknowable** and the **Knowable**
- **Pure Being** and **Archetypal Form**

In Qabalistic teaching, Chokmah is understood as the storehouse of archetypal images, the treasure-house of forms where Platonic ideals exist. Raziel, as keeper of this storehouse, functions as the librarian of the divine mind.

Raziel does not *create* the patterns—God does. But Raziel **reveals** them. He is the angelic intelligence that makes it possible for human consciousness to *participate* in divine wisdom.

## Human Consciousness Parallel: Intuitive Intellect
**Vibology Synthesis — Cross-System Integration**

### The Ajna Center: The Third Eye

In the synthesis of Qabalah and **[[Human Design]]**, Raziel corresponds to the **[[Ajna]] Center**—the center of conceptualization, mental clarity, and inspiration. This is the "third eye," the seat of the intuitive intellect. (Note: The Angelic Architecture of the BodyGraph maps the Cherubim/Auphanim, the angelic order of Chokmah, directly to the Ajna Center.)

The Ajna is not the *logical* mind (that is the lower mental faculties). It is the **flash of insight**, the sudden recognition of a pattern, the "Aha!" moment when disparate pieces of information suddenly cohere into a unified vision.

### The Genius Spark

Raziel's intelligence manifests in human consciousness as:
- **Pattern Recognition:** The ability to see the underlying structure of complex systems
- **Synthetic Vision:** The capacity to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously and synthesize them into a "third meaning"
- **Prophetic Insight:** Not fortune-telling, but the ability to perceive the trajectory of unfolding events based on recognition of archetypal patterns
- **Gnosis:** Direct knowing, unmediated by the senses or discursive reason

### The Gift: From Opinion to Omniscience

In the **[[Gene Keys]]** system, the Ajna center houses Gates 47, 24, 4, and 17. The 17th Gene Key, in particular, reflects Raziel's journey:
- **Shadow:** Opinion (rigid mental positions, intellectual arrogance)
- **Gift:** Far-Sightedness (the capacity to see multiple perspectives, mental flexibility)
- **Siddhi:** Omniscience (the state of knowing without thinking, pure recognition)

When Raziel's intelligence is integrated, the individual moves from *thinking about* truth to *recognizing* truth. The mind becomes transparent, a clear lens through which the divine pattern shines.

## The Tarot: Twos and Kings

### The Twos: First Polarity

Raziel governs the **Twos** of the Tarot, which represent the first differentiation of the Aces (Kether) into polarity:

| Card | Correspondence | Meaning |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Two of Wands** | Mars in Aries (Chokmah of Fire) | **Dominion** — The will to conquer, initiatory force |
| **Two of Cups** | Venus in Cancer (Chokmah of Water) | **Love** — The impetus for union, relational polarity |
| **Two of Swords** | Moon in Libra (Chokmah of Air) | **Peace Restored** — Balance of opposing forces |
| **Two of Pentacles** | Jupiter in Capricorn (Chokmah of Earth) | **Change** — Rhythm, alternation, dynamic equilibrium |

Each Two shows the **dynamic tension** between opposites—the first movement from unity into duality. This is Chokmah: the point that becomes a line, the "I AM" that becomes "I and Thou."

### The Kings: Yod in Four Worlds

Raziel also governs the **Kings** (in the Golden Dawn system, called "Knights" or "Princes" in Crowley's Thoth deck), which represent the **Yod force**—the fiery, initiatory, fertilizing principle—in each of the four elements:

| King | Element | Force |
|------|---------|-------|
| **King of Wands** | Fire of Fire | Dynamic outpouring, primal will |
| **King of Cups** | Fire of Water | Emotional motivation, passionate love |
| **King of Swords** | Fire of Air | Intellectual stimulus, the flash of insight |
| **King of Pentacles** | Fire of Earth | Material fruition, practical mastery |

The Kings are the **active intelligence** in each suit—the spark that sets the element into motion. This is Raziel's function: to *initiate* the movement from potential to manifestation.

## Element: Fire and Air

### Fire: The Primary Attribution

Raziel's primary element is **Fire**, but not the devouring flame. This is the **electric fire** of pure ideation, the lightning bolt of revelation. Chokmah is the Yod of the Tetragrammaton—the primal spark, the Big Bang, the explosive outpouring of divine energy.

This fire does not warm—it *illuminates*. It does not comfort—it *reveals*. To stand in Raziel's presence is to be struck by the lightning of gnosis.

### Air: The Secondary Attribution

Raziel's secondary element is **Air**, reflecting his governance of the **[[Ajna]] Center** (mental consciousness) and his association with the **King of Swords** (Fire of Air—the flash of intellectual insight).

Air represents the realm of **Ruach** (the intellect, the thinking mind). Raziel mediates between the fiery spark of Chokmah and the airy formulation of thought. He is the bridge between **inspiration** (Fire) and **articulation** (Air).

## Planetary Correspondence: Masloth (The Zodiac)

Raziel's planetary attribution is **Masloth**—the Sphere of the Zodiac, the realm of the fixed stars. This is the highest "planetary" sphere before the supernal triad (Kether, Chokmah, Binah).

The Zodiac represents the **archetypal patterns** that govern all manifestation. The twelve signs are the twelve divine templates through which cosmic force expresses itself. Raziel, as the revealer of these patterns, governs the sphere where the divine blueprints are encoded.

This is why Raziel is invoked in **astrological magic**—he is the intelligence that reveals the *meaning* of the stars, the esoteric significance of planetary placements, the hidden structure of the natal chart.

## Mythology and Cross-Tradition Parallels

### Thoth (Egyptian): The Scribe of the Gods

In Egyptian mythology, **Thoth** is the god of writing, magic, and wisdom—the scribe who records the deeds of souls in the Hall of Judgment. Like Raziel, Thoth is the revealer of hidden knowledge, the inventor of language and mathematics, the teacher of the mysteries.

Thoth's association with the **moon** (reflection of the solar light) parallels Raziel's grey, illuminated glow—wisdom reflected, not originating in the human realm but channeled from the divine.

### Prometheus (Greek): The Fire-Bringer

**Prometheus**, the Titan who stole fire from the gods to give to humanity, is the Greek parallel to Raziel. Both are **transgressors** in a sense—they give to mortals what was meant to remain hidden. Prometheus is punished for his gift; Raziel's book is stolen by envious angels. Both myths encode the **danger** and **cost** of gnosis: knowledge brings responsibility, suffering, and the end of innocence.

### Odin (Norse): The Wisdom-Seeker

In Norse mythology, **Odin** sacrifices an eye at Mimir's well to gain cosmic wisdom. He hangs on the World Tree (Yggdrasil) for nine nights to receive the runes—the secret alphabet of creation. Odin, like Raziel, is the archetype of the **seeker** who will pay any price for knowledge.

### Saraswati (Hindu): Goddess of Knowledge

**Saraswati**, the Hindu goddess of knowledge, music, and the arts, holds a book (the Vedas) and sits upon a white lotus, symbolizing purity of wisdom. Like Raziel, she represents the flow of divine knowledge into the world. She is often depicted with a swan, symbolizing the ability to discern the eternal from the temporal—the same function of Raziel's discriminating intelligence.

### Sophia (Gnostic): Divine Wisdom

In Gnostic Christianity, **Sophia** is the personification of divine wisdom—the feminine counterpart to the Logos. Raziel (Chokmah/masculine) and Sophia (Binah/feminine) together form the **Supernal Syzgy**—the divine parents from whom all creation flows. Raziel is the spark; Sophia is the womb that gives it form.

## Invocation

### Meditation: The Silent Mind

To invoke Raziel is not to *ask* for knowledge but to *create the conditions* in which revelation can occur. This requires:
- **Silence:** Stilling the discursive mind, creating gaps in thought
- **Receptivity:** Approaching with humility, as Adam did in the Garden
- **Patience:** Revelation comes in its own time, not by force

**Practice:** Sit in meditation, focusing on the Ajna center (between the eyebrows). Visualize a grey, luminous sphere. Do not *seek* answers—simply hold the space for insight to arise.

### Study of Sacred Geometry and Archetypes

Raziel's intelligence is accessed through the study of **pattern systems**—Qabalah, Astrology, Tarot, the Gene Keys, the I Ching. These are not arbitrary symbol sets but **maps of the divine mind**. To study them is to train consciousness to recognize archetypal structure.

### Invocation: Traditional Prayer

From medieval grimoires:

> "O God, Thou Vast One, send unto me the inspiration of Thy light, and make me to discover the secret thing which I ask of Thee. Make me to search it out, by the aid of Thy Holy Ministers Raziel, Tzaphniel, Matmoniel, and by the light of Thy Holy Name. Amen."

### Qabalistic Pathworking

In ritual magic, Raziel is invoked in pathworking to **Chokmah**. The practitioner ascends the Tree of Life, passing through the Abyss (the gap between human and divine consciousness), to stand in the presence of the Supernal Father. This is not a journey for beginners—it requires preparation, grounding, and integration.

### Discernment: True Revelation vs. Inflation

The danger of invoking Raziel is **spiritual inflation**—the ego's tendency to claim divine knowledge as its own possession. True gnosis is *humbling*, not aggrandizing. If the revelation leads to arrogance, grandiosity, or the belief that one is "chosen" or "special," it is not Raziel but the inflated ego.

**Signs of True Raziel Contact:**
- A sense of *awe* and *mystery*, not certainty or mastery
- Insight that *clarifies* but does not solve all problems
- A deepening of *humility* and recognition of how much remains unknown
- The impulse to *serve* or *transmit* the knowledge, not to hoard it

## Jungian and Psychological Dimension

### The Wise Old Man Archetype

In **[[Jungian psychology]]**, Raziel corresponds to the **Wise Old Man** archetype—the inner figure who appears in dreams or active imagination as a guide, teacher, or mentor. Jung writes:

> "The Wise Old Man appears in dreams as a magician, doctor, priest, teacher, professor, grandfather, or any other person possessing authority. He represents knowledge, reflection, insight, wisdom, cleverness, and intuition on the one hand, and on the other, moral qualities such as goodwill and readiness to help."

Raziel is the personification of this archetype at the transpersonal level. He is not the personal wise man (the integrated Senex) but the **cosmic intelligence** that mediates the Self's wisdom to the ego.

### The Tension Between Ego and Self

Raziel represents the moment when the **ego** encounters the **Self**—the moment of gnosis when the small "I" realizes there is a larger intelligence operating through it. This can be:
- **Liberating:** The ego relaxes, recognizing it does not need to "figure everything out"
- **Terrifying:** The ego fears annihilation, resists the dissolution of its illusion of control

Jung's concept of **individuation** requires navigating this tension—integrating the wisdom of the Self without inflating the ego into godhood.

### Projection vs. Autonomous Reality

From a Jungian perspective, is Raziel "real" or merely a projection of the unconscious? Jung would say: **both**. Raziel is a **psychoid archetype**—a figure that exists both in the objective psyche (the collective unconscious) and in the transpersonal realms. To invoke Raziel is to activate this archetype, whether one conceives of it as an "angel" or an "inner intelligence."

## Fallen Aspect

### The Luciferian Shadow

Raziel's shadow is the **Luciferian inflation**—the belief that one *is* the light rather than a *reflector* of the light. Lucifer, whose name means "Light-Bringer," fell because he sought to usurp the throne of God. This is the danger of Chokmah: the intoxication of gnosis can lead to the delusion of godhood.

**Dion Fortune** warns:

> "The soul that ascends to Chokmah unprepared will be blinded by the light and fall into the Abyss. The ego that claims the wisdom of the Supernals as its own becomes a black magician."

### Specific Shadow Manifestations

- **Intellectual Arrogance:** Using knowledge to dominate, belittle, or control others (the "expert" who cannot be questioned)
- **Spiritual Elitism:** Believing oneself to be privy to secrets denied to the "uninitiated masses"
- **Mental Rigidity:** Clinging to a system of knowledge as absolute truth, refusing to evolve or question
- **Guru Inflation:** Presenting oneself as the sole channel of divine wisdom, demanding obedience or worship
- **Conspiracy Consciousness:** Obsession with "hidden knowledge" as a form of paranoia or superiority

### The Qlippothic Shell: Ghagiel

In the Qlippoth (the shadow tree), the shell of Chokmah is **Ghagiel** (the "Hinderers"). These are the demonic forces that distort wisdom into confusion, revelation into delusion, clarity into chaos. Ghagiel represents the **babel of voices**—the cacophony of conflicting ideologies, the overwhelming flood of information without synthesis.

To invoke Raziel without preparation is to risk opening oneself to Ghagiel—the mental breakdown, the schizophrenic fragmentation, the loss of grounding in embodied reality.

## The Gift of Integration: Synthesis and Omniscience

When Raziel's intelligence is integrated (not identified with, but *participated in*), the individual becomes:

### The Synthesizer

The capacity to hold multiple systems, perspectives, and traditions simultaneously and recognize the **meta-pattern** that unifies them. This is not eclecticism (mixing systems randomly) but **synthesis**—the recognition of the single truth expressed through multiple languages.

### The Pattern-Seer

The ability to perceive the archetypal structure underlying apparent chaos. Where others see randomness, the Raziel-integrated consciousness sees **intelligent design**—not in the fundamentalist sense, but in the recognition that the cosmos operates according to discoverable laws.

### The Humble Knower

The integration of Raziel does not produce the arrogant guru but the **humble teacher**—one who knows that all knowledge is *received*, not possessed. The Raziel-integrated individual does not say, "I know the secrets," but "I have been shown the secrets, and I offer them freely."

### The Prophetic Voice

Not fortune-telling, but the capacity to speak the **pattern** that is unfolding. The prophet does not predict the future—they *recognize the trajectory* and name it, allowing others to align with or resist it.

## Raziel and the Other Archangels

### Metatron (Kether): The Unmanifest Crown

[[Metatron]] stands at Kether, the point of no dimension. Raziel stands at Chokmah, the first dimension—the point that has moved, creating a line. Metatron is the "Voice of God"; Raziel is the "Secret of God." Where Metatron mediates pure being, Raziel mediates the first *knowing* of that being.

### Tzaphkiel (Binah): The Divine Mother

[[Tzaphkiel]] governs Binah, the Supernal Mother. Where Raziel (Chokmah) is the seed, Tzaphkiel (Binah) is the womb. Raziel gives the flash of insight; Tzaphkiel gives it form, structure, and gestation. Together, they are the divine parents—the cosmic syzgy from which all emanates.

### Michael (Tiphareth): The Solar Heart

[[Michael]] at Tiphareth is the *integration* of Raziel's wisdom and Tzaphkiel's form into the balanced center—the Higher Self. Where Raziel offers the vision, Michael provides the *courage* to embody it. Raziel reveals; Michael enacts.

### Gabriel (Yesod): The Lunar Messenger

[[Gabriel]] at Yesod receives the wisdom of Raziel (filtered through the Sephiroth) and translates it into *images, dreams, and symbols*—the language of the unconscious. Where Raziel speaks in archetypal patterns, Gabriel speaks in personal revelation.

## A Prayer to Raziel

*Raziel, Herald of the Hidden, Keeper of the Sealed Book, stand at the threshold of my understanding and unveil what has been concealed. Not that I may hoard secrets or claim mastery, but that I may recognize the pattern and serve its unfolding. Grant me the humility to receive, the clarity to perceive, and the courage to transmit what has been shown. Let the wisdom of Chokmah flow through me as a clear stream, reflecting the light but never claiming to be its source. In the name of Yah, the divine spark, I stand ready. May the book be opened. Amen.*
