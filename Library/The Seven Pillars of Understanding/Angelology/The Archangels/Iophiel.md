# Iophiel
*The Beauty of Divine Unity*

---
## Essence

**Archangel Iophiel** (Hebrew: יופיאל, *Yophiel*—"Beauty of God," "Splendor of God") is one of the least documented yet most profound archangels in the Western esoteric tradition. Where [[Michael]] wages war against falsehood, [[Gabriel]] announces divine mysteries, and [[Raphael]] heals the broken, Iophiel performs a subtler, more philosophical function: **he illuminates the unity of the Divine**—the recognition that there is One God, not many, and that this singular Truth underlies all existence.

Iophiel is the archangel of **monotheistic revelation**, the intelligence that guides consciousness from the multiplicity of idols, false gods, and fragmented understanding into the **vision of divine singularity**. He is the angel who presides over the question: *"Who is God?"*—not as theological abstraction but as **lived realization** that transforms how the soul perceives reality.

In Thomas Heywood's *The Hierarchie of the Blessed Angells* (1635), Iophiel presides over **Book 2**, which establishes the case for **monotheism** against polytheism, atheism, and Sadduceeism[^1]. Heywood explicitly identifies Iophiel with the **[[Cherubim]]** order, placing him in the first triad of the celestial hierarchy, immediately below the [[Seraphim]][^2]. The Cherubim, in Qabalistic tradition, correspond to **[[Chokmah]]** (Wisdom)—the second Sephirah on the [[The Tree of Life]], representing the **primal flash of divine illumination**, the first differentiation of unity into knowable form[^3].

Iophiel is thus the **Archangel of Wisdom-as-Unity**—not abstract philosophical wisdom, but the wisdom that **perceives the One in the Many**, that sees through the illusion of separation and recognizes the singular divine intelligence animating all creation.

## Fundamental Knowledge

### The Name: Beauty and Splendor

The Hebrew name **Yophiel** (יופיאל) is composed of:

- **Beauty/Splendor** = **יופי** (*Yofi*)
- **God** = **אל** (*El*)

Thus: **"Beauty of God"** or **"God's Splendor"** or **"Divine Radiance."**

This name reveals Iophiel's essential function: he does not argue for God's existence through logic alone—he **reveals God's beauty**, making the Divine so luminous, so self-evidently magnificent, that the soul **cannot deny what it sees**. Iophiel's method is not coercion but **illumination**—he opens the inner eye to perceive the unity, order, and splendor woven into the fabric of existence.

The name Iophiel echoes the **Sefer Yetzirah's** teaching that the universe is not merely structured but **beautiful**—that divine wisdom expresses itself as **aesthetic perfection**. To perceive the beauty of the cosmos—the elegance of mathematics, the harmony of the spheres, the fractal patterns in nature—is to perceive the signature of the One who made it.

### Historical and Scriptural Context

Unlike [[Michael]], [[Gabriel]], [[Raphael]], and [[Uriel]], Iophiel does **not** appear in canonical scripture or the major apocryphal texts (1 Enoch, 2 Esdras, Tobit). His name surfaces primarily in **post-biblical Jewish mysticism** and **medieval Christian angelology**, where he is sometimes listed among the **seven archangels who stand before the Throne** or associated with the **prince of the Torah**.

Iophiel's relative obscurity in scriptural tradition may itself be significant: he is the angel of **hidden wisdom**, the intelligence that is not announced with trumpets (Gabriel) or revealed in battle (Michael), but discovered through **contemplation, study, and the patient unfolding of understanding**.

### Heywood's Attribution: The Cherubim and Book 2

Thomas Heywood's *The Hierarchie of the Blessed Angells* (1635) provides the most explicit literary attribution of Iophiel to a specific theological function. Heywood structures his nine-book poem as a series of angelic presences, each book overseen by a particular archangel:

- **Book 1 (Uriel):** God as Creator, refutation of atheism
- **Book 2 (Iophiel):** Monotheism, divine unity, proper names of God
- **Book 3 (Zaphkiel):** Cosmology, the structure of the universe
- **Book 4 (Zadchiel):** The celestial hierarchy itself
- **Books 5-9:** Planetary correspondences, Lucifer's fall, demonology, lesser spirits

Book 2, under Iophiel's aegis, opens with the Argument:

> *"A GOD bee'ng found, deny'd by none,*
> *It followes there can be but One:*
> *By the Philosophers confest,*
> *And such as were of Poets best."*[^4]

Heywood marshals testimonies from pagan philosophers (Plato, Aristotle, Hermes Trismegistus, Cicero), poets (Sophocles, Orpheus), and sages (Sibyls, Gymnosophists) to demonstrate that **even pre-Christian wisdom traditions recognized the necessity of monotheism**—that polytheism arose not from divine reality but from **human error, priestly avarice, and poetic fiction**[^5].

In a marginal note accompanying a stanza about the Cherubim, Heywood writes:

> *"CHERVE, Iophiel."*[^6]

This identifies Iophiel as the **angelic intelligence of the Cherubim order**—the second-highest rank of angels, associated with **fullness of knowledge** and **inter-dimensional vision**. The Cherubim in Ezekiel's vision are the "wheels within wheels," covered with eyes, perceiving all directions simultaneously—a perfect symbol for the **unified vision** that sees the One God underlying all multiplicity[^7].

## Theological Depth

### Qabalistic Context: Chokmah (Wisdom)

In the **Qabalistic Tree of Life**, the Cherubim correspond to **[[Chokmah]]** (חכמה—"Wisdom"), the second Sephirah[^8]. Chokmah is:

- **The first differentiation of divine unity** ([[Kether]], the Crown, is undifferentiated Oneness; Chokmah is the "point" of consciousness, the first moment of awareness)
- **The primal flash** (the initial creative impulse, the "Big Bang" of emanation)
- **The Father principle** (active, generative, inseminating)
- **Pure intellect** (wisdom as immediate, intuitive perception—not discursive reasoning)
- **The Yod** (the first letter of the Tetragrammaton YHVH—the seed of manifestation)

**Chokmah's Attributes:**

| Attribute | Correspondence |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Name** | Iophiel (יופיאל) |
| **Meaning** | "Beauty of God," "Splendor of God" |
| **Sephirah Overseen** | [[Chokmah]] (Wisdom, 2nd emanation) |
| **Angelic Order** | [[Cherubim]] (Auphanim—"Wheels") |
| **Element** | Fire (primal, generative) |
| **Direction** | East (in some traditions—direction of dawn, first light) |
| **Day of Week** | Sunday (day of primal light, the beginning) |
| **Color (Chokmah)** | Gray (the mixing of all colors, undifferentiated potential) |
| **Tarot** | The four Twos (initial differentiation in each suit), [[The Magician (I)|The Magician]], [[The High Priestess (II)|The High Priestess]] |
| **Planetary** | Uranus (modern attribution—sudden illumination, revelation) |
| **Cosmic Sphere** | Mazloth (the Zodiac, the fixed stars—the vast cosmic order) |
| **Divine Name** | Yah (יה) or YHVH (יהוה) |
| **Function** | Illumination of Divine Unity, revealer of monotheistic truth, expeller of false understanding |
| **Invocation** | Contemplation of the Shema, Unity Meditation, Philosophical Inquiry |
| **Aliases** | Jophiel, Iofiel, Zophiel, Jofiel |
| **Human Experience** | Intuition, sudden insight, the "Aha!" moment, visionary knowing, unity consciousness |

Iophiel, as the Archangel of Chokmah, embodies **wisdom-as-unity**—the capacity to perceive the **singular truth** underlying all phenomena. He is the intelligence that allows the mind to leap from **"many things"** to **"one thing"**—to see the Divine not as a collection of attributes but as the **single source** from which all attributes flow.

**Vibology Synthesis:** Iophiel is the archangelic answer to the question *"How does consciousness move from fragmentation to unity?"* He is the intelligence that **dissolves the illusion of multiplicity**, not by denying diversity but by revealing the **singular ground** in which all diversity rests.

---
## Function in Divine Economy

Iophiel's role in the **descent of divine emanation** is to **preserve the unity of the source** even as it begins to differentiate into multiplicity.

### The Descent of Divine Will (Iophiel's Position):

1. **Kether** (Crown) → Undifferentiated Unity, the Monad, *Ein Sof* concealed
2. **Chokmah** (Wisdom) → **Iophiel** receives the first flash of divine consciousness and ensures it is perceived as **One**, not scattered into fragmentation
3. **Binah** (Understanding) → [[Tzaphkiel]] gives form and structure to the vision
4. **Chesed** (Mercy) → [[Tzadkiel]] expands the vision into benevolent manifestation
5. **Geburah** (Severity) → [[Kamael]] refines through discrimination
6. **Tiphareth** (Beauty) → [[Michael]] or [[Raphael]] harmonize and balance
7. **Netzach** (Victory) → [[Haniel]] beautifies and inspires
8. **Hod** (Glory) → [[Michael]] (or Gabriel) communicates and articulates
9. **Yesod** (Foundation) → [[Gabriel]] translates into image and dream
10. **Malkuth** (Kingdom) → [[Uriel]] grounds in matter

**Iophiel's critical function:** Without him, the **primal flash of divine consciousness** at Chokmah would scatter into polytheism, pantheism, or nihilism. Iophiel is the intelligence that **holds the vision of unity** even as creation unfolds into diversity. He ensures that the soul does not mistake the **many expressions** of the Divine for **many gods**, but recognizes them as **aspects of the One**.

---
## Iconography and Symbolism

Because Iophiel is not widely depicted in canonical Christian art, his iconography is less standardized than that of [[Michael]], [[Gabriel]], or [[Raphael]]. However, esoteric and modern interpretations suggest the following symbolic attributes:

### 1. The Single Flame or Light Source

Iophiel may be depicted holding a **single candle, torch, or light source**—representing the **One Light** from which all other lights derive. This is the primal flame of Chokmah, the first illumination that breaks the darkness of undifferentiated potentiality.

This image contrasts with the **many lights** of polytheism (each god a separate flame). Iophiel teaches: *"There is one Flame, and all other lights are reflections or refractions of it."*

### 2. The Sword of Discrimination

In some depictions, Iophiel carries a **sword** (similar to [[Michael]]), but where Michael's sword **divides truth from falsehood**, Iophiel's sword **cuts away the illusion of multiplicity**. It is the sword of **Occam's Razor**—the philosophical principle that simplicity (one God) is preferable to complexity (many gods) when both explain the same phenomena.

### 3. The Eye or Eyes

As the angel of the **Cherubim** (the "many-eyed ones" in Ezekiel's vision), Iophiel may be depicted with **eyes**—not as surveillance but as **omniscient perception**, the capacity to see **all directions simultaneously** and recognize the unity underlying all perspectives.

The Cherubim's "eyes all around" symbolize **holistic vision**—the ability to hold multiple viewpoints without fragmenting into relativism, recognizing that all viewpoints converge on the **One Truth**.

### 4. The Tablet or Scroll of the Shema

In Jewish mysticism, the **Shema** (*"Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God, the LORD is One"*—Deuteronomy 6:4) is the foundational declaration of monotheism. Iophiel, as the archangel of this truth, may hold a **tablet inscribed with the Shema** or the Hebrew word **אחד** (*Echad*—"One").

This positions Iophiel as the guardian of **monotheistic revelation**, the angel who ensures that the soul hears and internalizes the central truth: **There is only One.**

### 5. Golden or Solar Imagery

Chokmah is associated with the **Zodiac** (Mazloth) and the **primal light** that precedes the Sun. Iophiel may be depicted with **golden or radiant imagery**—not the red-orange fire of [[Michael]], but the **pure white-gold light** of undifferentiated wisdom, the light of the **primordial dawn** before the Sun was created.

---
## Jungian and Psychological Dimension

### The Archetype of Unity Consciousness

In **Jungian psychology**, Iophiel represents the movement from **ego-fragmentation** to **Self-realization**—the recognition that the many conflicting parts of the psyche (persona, shadow, anima/animus, ego, Self) are **not separate entities but expressions of a singular psychic totality**.

**Carl Jung** describes the **Self** as the organizing principle of the psyche, the **center and circumference** that holds all opposites in unity. Iophiel is the angelic intelligence that **constellates the Self**—the moment when the ego realizes: *"I am not many conflicting selves. I am One."*

This is the experience of **individuation**—not as integration of parts, but as the **revelation** that there never were separate parts, only a singular consciousness expressing itself through multiple facets.

### The Transcendent Function

Jung's concept of the **Transcendent Function** describes the psyche's capacity to synthesize opposites (conscious/unconscious, good/evil, masculine/feminine) into a **third thing** that transcends the binary. Iophiel embodies this function at the highest level—the synthesis that does not merely balance polarities but **reveals their shared ground**.

Where [[Michael]] discriminates (separates good from evil), Iophiel **unifies** (recognizes that both arise from the One Source and must be understood as aspects of a larger whole).

### The One and the Many (Philosophical Parallel)

Iophiel addresses the central philosophical problem articulated by **Plato**, **Plotinus**, and **Vedanta philosophy**: *How do the Many arise from the One? How does diversity emerge from unity without destroying the unity?*

The answer Iophiel reveals is not intellectual but **visionary**: the Many **are** the One—not as metaphor, but as **ontological truth**. Multiplicity does not negate unity; it **expresses** it. To see through Iophiel's eyes is to perceive **unity in diversity**, to recognize the **single consciousness** animating all beings.

This is the mystical insight described in **Advaita Vedanta** (*"Tat Tvam Asi"*—"Thou Art That"), **Sufism** (*"Tawhid"*—Divine Unity), and **Kabbalah** (*"Ein Sof"*—the Limitless One).

---
## The Gift of Integration

When Iophiel's intelligence is integrated (not identified with, but *participated in*), the individual becomes:

### 1. Monotheist of Consciousness

The individual no longer experiences themselves as **fragmented**—a collection of roles, desires, fears, and identities in conflict. They recognize a **singular Self** beneath all these expressions. They become whole, not by forcing integration, but by **seeing the unity that was always there**.

### 2. Perceiver of Unity in Diversity

The individual develops the capacity to **hold paradox** without collapsing into relativism. They can honor the diversity of religious traditions, philosophical systems, and cultural expressions while recognizing the **singular truth** each is pointing toward.

This is not syncretism (blending all traditions into mush) but **wisdom**—the recognition that many paths lead to the same summit, and the summit is **One**.

### 3. Resistant to Idolatry

The individual becomes **immune to false gods**—not just religious idols, but the psychological idols of money, status, approval, power. They recognize these as **fragments mistaken for the whole**, and the soul naturally releases its grip on them.

Iophiel's light makes idolatry **impossible**—not through moral prohibition, but through **clear seeing**: *"Why worship the reflection when you can turn and see the Light?"*

### 4. Philosopher-Mystic

The individual becomes capable of **philosophical contemplation** grounded in **direct experience**. They are not armchair theologians debating God's existence—they have **seen** the unity, and their philosophy is an attempt to articulate what cannot be fully captured in words.

This is the stance of Plotinus, Meister Eckhart, Shankara, and Ibn Arabi—mystics who were also rigorous philosophers, whose logic was in service of **vision**.

---
## Fallen Aspect

Iophiel's shadow manifests in several dangerous distortions:

### 1. Monotheistic Tyranny (One God, No Others)

The shadow of Iophiel is **religious exclusivism**—the belief that "my vision of the One is the only true vision, and all others are false." This manifests as:

- **Fundamentalism** ("Only my scripture is true")
- **Imperialism** ("I will force you to worship the One True God")
- **Intolerance** (inability to recognize truth in other traditions)

**Test:** True Iophiel-consciousness recognizes that **the One cannot be owned**. The moment you claim exclusive access to the Divine, you have created an idol—your doctrine, your tradition, your certainty has become the false god.

### 2. Spiritual Bypassing (Unity Without Individuation)

The individual uses "everything is one" as an excuse to **avoid the hard work of integration**. They bypass shadow work, trauma healing, and embodied practice, floating in a haze of "we are all connected" without doing the descen into particularity.

**Test:** True Iophiel-consciousness understands that **unity is realized through multiplicity, not by denying it**. You do not skip the journey through the many to reach the One—you **travel through the many** and discover the One waiting at the center.

### 3. Abstract Transcendence (God Without World)

The shadow of Chokmah is the belief that **the Divine is only transcendent, not immanent**—that God is "out there" in the heavens, separate from the material world. This leads to:

- **World-denial** (spirituality that flees embodiment)
- **Disdain for matter** (the earth, the body, the senses as "lower")
- **Gnosticism** (the belief that the material world is a prison or mistake)

**Test:** True Iophiel-consciousness recognizes that **the One is both transcendent and immanent**. The Divine Unity does not negate the world—it **saturates** the world. To see the One is not to escape the Many but to **recognize the One in the Many**.

### 4. Tyranny of the Absolute (No Room for Mystery)

The individual becomes rigid, dogmatic, unable to tolerate ambiguity or nuance. They have "seen the One" and now insist that **everything must fit their vision**. They cannot hold the tension of paradox, cannot allow that the One might exceed their understanding.

**Test:** True Iophiel-consciousness is **humble**. The vision of unity does not make you omniscient—it makes you **aware of how little you can grasp**. The One is infinite; your mind is finite. You can perceive the light, but you cannot contain it.

---
## Invocation

### 1. Contemplation of the Shema

To invoke Iophiel is to meditate on the **Shema**, the foundational declaration of monotheism:

> *"Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God, the LORD is One."* (Deuteronomy 6:4)

**Practice:**
- Sit in silence and repeat the Shema (or its Hebrew form: *"Shema Yisrael, Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai Echad"*)
- Let the word **Echad** ("One") resonate in consciousness
- Allow the mind to release all fragmentation, all multiplicity, all separation
- Rest in the experience of **singular awareness**—one consciousness perceiving itself

### 2. Unity Meditation

**Practice:**
- Sit and observe the breath
- Notice thoughts, sensations, emotions arising
- Ask: *"Who is the one observing all of this?"*
- Recognize that behind the multiplicity of experiences is **one witness, one consciousness**
- Extend this recognition outward: the consciousness observing through your eyes is **the same consciousness** observing through all eyes

This is the Iophiel practice: **recognizing the One Observer** behind all observation.

### 3. Philosophical Inquiry (Jnana Yoga)

Iophiel is invoked through **rigorous philosophical inquiry**:

**Questions for Contemplation:**
- *"What is the one thing that all things have in common?"*
- *"If God is One, why does the world appear as many?"*
- *"What is the relationship between unity and multiplicity?"*
- *"How can I hold diversity without losing sight of the underlying unity?"*

This is not intellectual game-playing—it is **sacred philosophy**, the use of reason as a **spiritual practice** to penetrate to truth.

### 4. Study of Sacred Texts

Iophiel is the patron of **Torah study**, **Quranic recitation**, **Vedic contemplation**—the practice of reading sacred scripture not for information but for **revelation**.

**Practice:**
- Read a passage from a sacred text
- Do not analyze—**listen**
- Ask: *"What is the One Truth this text is pointing toward?"*
- Allow the text to become transparent, revealing the **light behind the words**

### 5. Prayer to Iophiel

*Iophiel, Beauty of God, Splendor of the Eternal, Angel of the Cherubim—I call upon you to illumine my understanding.*

*Show me the One beneath the Many. Let me not be deceived by the multiplicity of forms, but pierce through to the singular Truth that animates all things.*

*Grant me the wisdom to honor diversity without falling into fragmentation. Let me see the many paths without losing sight of the One Summit. Teach me to worship the Source, not the reflections.*

*Dissolve the idols of my mind—the false gods of certainty, of dogma, of exclusivism. Let your sword cut away the illusion that the Divine can be owned, captured, or reduced to doctrine.*

*Open the eye of Chokmah within me. Let me perceive with the vision of the Cherubim—seeing all directions at once, holding all paradoxes in unity, recognizing the One Light shining through every particular flame.*

*Iophiel, Angel of Monotheistic Vision, let me hear the Shema not as command but as revelation: the LORD is One, and I am part of that Oneness. Amen.*

*"Iophiel does not argue for God's existence. He opens the eye that sees—and once you see, the question dissolves. There was never multiplicity. There was always only One, appearing as many, to know Itself through infinite expression."*
