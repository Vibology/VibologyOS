# The Archangels
*Princes of the Celestial Realm*

*The Great Messengers, the Named Ones, the Commanders of Heaven*

**Eleven Archangelic Intelligences — Mediators Between Divine Will and Human Destiny**

---
## Essence

> *Vibology Synthesis: Individual archangel names and scriptural appearances are verified in the Esoteric Grimoire (Davidson). The Qabalistic Sephirothic assignments (Wang, Golden Dawn system) are verified. The eleven-archangel framework and cross-system correspondences are Vibology integrations.*

The **Archangels** are the **named angels**—the individual celestial intelligences who have revealed themselves throughout sacred history, bearing specific names, functions, and personalities (Davidson, *A Dictionary of Angels*). Unlike the nine orders of angels (which represent *classes* or *types* of angelic consciousness), the Archangels are **distinct beings**, each with a unique mission, sphere of influence, and relationship to humanity.

In the celestial hierarchy, the term "Archangel" appears in two distinct but related senses:

1. **As an Order** (Order 8) — The eighth of nine angelic orders in Pseudo-Dionysius's hierarchy, dwelling in [[Hod]] (Splendor) on the Qabalistic Tree of Life. This order consists of many beings who serve as messengers of divine decrees. See [[Archangels]].

2. **As Individual Princes** — The specific, named archangels who transcend their nominal position in the hierarchy to wield authority across multiple Sephiroth. These are the **Archangels** (capitalized, plural referring to the named individuals): Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, and seven others who govern the cosmic intelligences of the Tree of Life.

This overview addresses the **second sense**—the eleven named Archangels who serve as **overseers of the Sephiroth**, commanders of angelic orders, and direct intermediaries between God and humanity.

## The Eleven Archangels of the Sephiroth

In the Qabalistic tradition, each of the ten Sephiroth (and sometimes Daath, the hidden eleventh) is governed by an Archangel who embodies that sphere's intelligence and mediates its function to creation. These are not merely "members" of Order 8—they are **princes of the celestial realm**, wielding authority comparable to or exceeding the highest orders.

| Archangel | Hebrew | Sephirah | Sphere | Element | Function |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| [[Metatron]] | מטטרון | [[Kether]] | Primum Mobile | Fire/Spirit | The Voice of God, the Lesser YHVH, King of Angels |
| [[Raziel]] | רזיאל | [[Chokmah]] | Zodiac | Fire | Keeper of Secrets, Herald of Mysteries, Revealer of Divine Wisdom |
| [[Tzaphkiel]] | צפקיאל | [[Binah]] | Saturn | Water/Earth | Contemplator of God, Guardian of Form, Prince of Spiritual Strife |
| [[Tzadkiel]] | צדקיאל | [[Chesed]] | Jupiter | Water | Prince of Mercy, Bestower of Grace, Lord of Abundance |
| [[Kamael]] | כמאל | [[Geburah]] | Mars | Fire | Warrior of Severity, Executor of Justice, Champion of God |
| [[Raphael]] | רפאל | [[Tiphareth]] | Sun | Air | The Healer, Guide of Travelers, Restorer of Wholeness |
| [[Haniel]] | חניאל | [[Netzach]] | Venus | Water/Earth | Prince of Love, Guardian of Nature, Angel of Grace and Beauty |
| [[Michael]] | מיכאל | [[Hod]]* | Mercury* | Fire | Defender, Dragon-Slayer, Sword of Discrimination, Prince of the Sun |
| [[Gabriel]] | גבריאל | [[Yesod]] | Moon | Water | The Messenger, Herald of Change, Guardian of Dreams and Visions |
| [[Sandalphon]] | סנדלפון | [[Malkuth]] | Earth | Earth | The Tall Angel, Prayer-Weaver, Guardian of Embodiment |
| [[Uriel]] | אוריאל | [[Daath]]** | Hidden | Earth/Fire | Light in Darkness, Presider over Tartarus, Interpreter of Prophecy |
\* Michael's traditional attribution is **Tiphareth** (Sun), though some traditions place him in Hod or Geburah. This library follows the Tiphareth attribution based on his solar nature and role as defender of the Higher Self.

\** Uriel's position is contested—sometimes placed at Malkuth, sometimes Daath, sometimes hovering between them. This reflects his role as guardian of hidden wisdom and the threshold between manifest and unmanifest.

## The Four Archangels of the Quarters

Four archangels are particularly prominent in both scripture and esoteric practice, invoked as **guardians of the four cardinal directions** and the **four elements**:

### [[Michael]] — South, Fire
*"Who is as God?"* — The warrior, the defender, the dragon-slayer. Michael wields the flaming sword of discrimination, defends the soul against inflation and chaos, and stands as the guardian of the Higher Self. Associated with the Sun, Tiphareth, and the element of Fire.

**Invocation:** *"Behind me, Michael"* (traditional) or *"On my right hand, Michael"* (LBRP)
**Function:** Courage, discrimination, spiritual warfare, defense of truth
**Biblical:** Daniel 10-12, Jude 1:9, Revelation 12:7-9

### [[Gabriel]] — West, Water
*"Strength of God"* or *"God is my Strength"* — The messenger, the herald, the announcer of divine change. Gabriel appears at thresholds—births, deaths, visions—bearing messages that alter destiny. Associated with the Moon, Yesod, and the element of Water.

**Invocation:** *"Before me, Raphael; Behind me, Gabriel"* (traditional LBRP)
**Function:** Revelation, annunciation, dreams, intuition, threshold guidance
**Biblical:** Daniel 8-9, Luke 1:11-38 (Annunciation)

### [[Raphael]] — East, Air
*"God heals"* — The healer, the guide, the restorer of wholeness. Raphael mends what is broken, guides travelers through dangerous passages, and reveals the path to integration. Associated with the Sun (in some traditions) or Mercury, Tiphareth or Hod, and the element of Air.

**Invocation:** *"Before me, Raphael"* (LBRP)
**Function:** Healing, guidance, restoration, safe passage, integration
**Biblical:** Book of Tobit (Apocrypha), Book of Enoch

### [[Uriel]] — North, Earth
*"Light of God"* or *"Fire of God"* — The most enigmatic archangel, excluded from canonical scripture but central to esoteric tradition. Uriel illuminates the darkness, presides over the underworld, and reveals hidden knowledge. Associated with Earth, Malkuth (or Daath), and the element of Earth (with fire within).

**Invocation:** *"On my left hand, Uriel"* (LBRP)
**Function:** Illumination in shadow, prophecy, earth wisdom, descent into the underworld
**Biblical:** 2 Esdras (Apocrypha), Book of Enoch

## The Seven Planetary Archangels

In addition to the four directional archangels, three others complete the **seven planetary intelligences**:

- **Tzadkiel** (Jupiter) — Expansion, mercy, beneficence
- **Kamael** (Mars) — Strength, severity, discrimination
- **Haniel** (Venus) — Love, beauty, harmony

These seven archangels correspond to the seven classical planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) and the seven days of the week. They are invoked in planetary magic, astrological timing, and the mediation of celestial forces into earthly affairs.

---
## The Supernal Archangels

Three archangels dwell in the **Supernal Triad** (Kether, Chokmah, Binah)—the three highest Sephiroth, positioned above the Abyss, beyond the reach of ordinary human consciousness:

### [[Metatron]] — Kether, the Crown
The highest of all archangels, sometimes called the "Lesser YHVH" or the "Voice of God." Metatron is the celestial scribe, the angel who mediates the ineffable divine presence to creation. He is humanity ascended (Enoch transformed) and divinity descending—the meeting point of human and divine.

### [[Raziel]] — Chokmah, Wisdom
The keeper of divine secrets, the revealer of mysteries, the angel who gave Adam the book of cosmic knowledge after the Fall. Raziel mediates the explosive, undifferentiated wisdom of Chokmah—the Big Bang of consciousness, the primal Logos.

### [[Tzaphkiel]] — Binah, Understanding
The silent contemplator, the guardian of form, the watcher at the threshold of the Abyss. Tzaphkiel presides over the Great Sea of Binah, the cosmic womb where all potentials are held before crystallizing into manifestation.

---
## Functions and Roles

The Archangels serve multiple functions across the celestial and human realms:

### 1. Governors of the Sephiroth
Each archangel mediates the intelligence of their assigned Sephirah, ensuring that its qualities manifest correctly throughout the four worlds (Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah, Assiah).

### 2. Commanders of Angelic Orders
Each archangel oversees an angelic order (Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, etc.), directing their activities and ensuring cosmic order is maintained.

### 3. Mediators to Humanity
The archangels appear in visions, dreams, and moments of crisis, delivering messages, offering guidance, and intervening in human affairs when divine will requires it.

### 4. Guardians of Thresholds
The archangels stand at critical thresholds—birth, death, initiation, transformation—ensuring safe passage and proper alignment with divine purpose.

### 5. Warriors Against Chaos
Several archangels (Michael, Kamael, Tzaphkiel) serve as defenders of cosmic order, opposing forces of chaos, dissolution, and rebellion.

---
## Invocation

### Invocation
The archangels are invoked in ceremonial magic, meditation, and prayer. The **Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP)** establishes a sacred space by calling the four directional archangels as guardians:

> *"Before me, Raphael.*
> *Behind me, Gabriel.*
> *On my right hand, Michael.*
> *On my left hand, Uriel.*
> *For about me flames the Pentagram,*
> *And within me shines the six-rayed Star."*

### Planetary Timing
Each archangel is invoked on their associated day and planetary hour:
- **Sunday (Sun):** Michael or Raphael
- **Monday (Moon):** Gabriel
- **Tuesday (Mars):** Kamael
- **Wednesday (Mercury):** Raphael (in some traditions)
- **Thursday (Jupiter):** Tzadkiel
- **Friday (Venus):** Haniel
- **Saturday (Saturn):** Tzaphkiel

### Meditation and Pathworking
Meditate on the archangels by visualizing their associated Sephirah, color, symbol, and function. Ask for their guidance in cultivating the qualities they embody.

### Discernment
Not every voice that claims angelic authority is genuine. The archangels test the soul, demand integrity, and reveal truth—often uncomfortable truth. True archangelic presence is marked by:
- **Numinosity** — Awe, reverence, trembling
- **Clarity** — Truth that cuts through confusion
- **Demand for integrity** — No coddling of the ego
- **Alignment with sacred tradition** — Consistency with scriptural and mystical sources

## Archangels vs. Angels (Order 8)

**Critical Distinction:**

- **The Archangels** (these eleven named beings) are **princes** who govern Sephiroth and command entire orders. They transcend the nominal hierarchy.

- **The Order of Archangels** (Order 8, dwelling in Hod) consists of many unnamed beings who serve as messengers of divine decrees, mediating between the Principalities and the Angels.

The named Archangels (Michael, Gabriel, etc.) are *of* the Archangelic order in essence (they are messengers), but they wield authority *beyond* that order. Michael commands the Virtues (Order 6), yet he is called "Archangel Michael." This paradox reflects the nature of angelic nomenclature—titles overlap, functions interpenetrate, and hierarchy is fluid rather than rigid.

---
## The Archangels in Human Consciousness

In Jungian terms, the archangels represent **archetypal intelligences**—autonomous psychic structures that mediate between the ego and the Self. To encounter an archangel (whether in vision, synchronicity, or inner knowing) is to meet an aspect of the deep psyche that cannot be reduced to personal experience.

**Michael** = The capacity for discrimination, courage, and defense of the Higher Self
**Gabriel** = The capacity to receive revelation and respond to vocation
**Raphael** = The capacity for healing, integration, and wholeness
**Uriel** = The capacity to descend into shadow and retrieve hidden wisdom
**Tzadkiel** = The capacity for mercy, generosity, and sovereignty
**Kamael** = The capacity for necessary destruction and discriminating power
**Haniel** = The capacity for love, beauty, and embodied relationship
**Tzaphkiel** = The capacity for contemplation and form-giving
**Raziel** = The capacity to receive and transmit divine secrets
**Metatron** = The capacity to mediate the absolute into the comprehensible
**Sandalphon** = The capacity to ground spirit in matter and embody prayer

*"The Archangels are not merely cosmic functionaries. They are the living intelligence of divine attributes, the personal faces of impersonal forces, the voices through which the Infinite speaks to the finite. To know them is to recognize that the universe is not a cold mechanism but a living conversation between Creator and creation."*
