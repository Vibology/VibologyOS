# Metatron
*The Chancellor of Heaven*

---
## Essence

**The Supreme Archangel — Prince of Countenances, The Lesser YHVH, The Sustainer of Mankind, Bridge Between Human and Divine**

---
## Correspondences

**Metatron** (Hebrew: מטטרון, *Metatron* or *Mettatron*) is the most exalted and mysterious of all the Archangels, occupying a position so elevated that he stands at the **threshold between the created and the Uncreated**. His name, variously translated as *"Beside the Throne,"* *"Chancellor of Heaven,"* or *"One Who Serves Behind the Throne,"* positions him as the **immediate presence** of the Divine Will, the first emanation through which the ineffable Godhead becomes comprehensible to lesser intelligences.

Metatron is unique among the Archangels for two reasons: first, he is the **only angel associated with Kether**, the Crown, the first and highest Sephira on the Qabalistic Tree of Life—the sphere of pure divine unity before differentiation. Second, according to mystical tradition (particularly *3 Enoch* or *Sefer Hekhalot*), Metatron **was once human**—the patriarch Enoch, who "walked with God, and he was not, for God took him" (Genesis 5:24). This transformation from mortal to angel makes Metatron the **exemplar of human apotheosis**, the living proof that the human soul can ascend to the highest angelic station.

### The Name: Beside the Throne

The etymology of *Metatron* is debated among scholars. Unlike other Archangelic names (Michael = "Who is as God?", Gabriel = "God is my strength"), Metatron's name does not follow the standard Hebrew theophoric pattern (ending in *-el*). Several theories exist:

1. **Greek Origin:** From *meta* (after/beyond) + *thronos* (throne) = "One who serves behind the throne" or "Beside the throne"
2. **Latin Origin:** From *metator* (guide/measurer) = "The one who measures and guides" (Davidson, *A Dictionary of Angels*)
3. **Hebrew Corruption:** From *Matara* (keeper/guardian) = "The keeper of the watch"
4. **Mystical Cipher:** 3 Enoch mentions a gematria value of 71 for "Lesser YAH" associated with Metatron

The *Zohar* refers to Metatron as **"The Lesser YHVH"** (*YHVH ha-Katan*), suggesting that he bears the **Tetragrammaton itself** within his nature—the unpronounceable name of God. Exodus 23:20-21 states:

> *"Behold, I send an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared. Pay careful attention to him and obey his voice; do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgression, **for my name is in him.**"*

This verse, though not explicitly naming Metatron, is traditionally interpreted as referring to him—the angel who **carries the divine name** and thus possesses authority second only to God Himself.

### Apocryphal Foundation: Enoch's Transformation

The most detailed account of Metatron's origin appears in **3 Enoch** (also called *Sefer Hekhalot*, "The Book of Palaces"), a Jewish mystical text from the 5th-6th century CE. In this text, Rabbi Ishmael ascends to the seventh heaven and encounters Metatron, who reveals his extraordinary history:

> *"I am Enoch the son of Jared. When the generation of the Flood sinned and turned to evil deeds, the Holy One, blessed be He, removed me from their midst to be a witness against them in the heavenly height... And the Holy One, blessed be He, laid His hand upon me and blessed me with 1,365,000 blessings. He made me great and increased me until I matched the world in length and breadth. He made me seventy-two wings... and called my name **'The Lesser YHVH.'**"* (3 Enoch 4-10, paraphrased)

Enoch, the seventh patriarch from Adam (Genesis 5:21-24), is described as one who "walked with God" for 365 years—a number representing the solar year, suggesting his alignment with cosmic order. His translation into Metatron represents the **supreme individuation**—the human soul so purified, so aligned with divine will, that it transcends mortality entirely and is absorbed into the angelic hierarchy at its highest station.

This narrative has profound implications: **Metatron is the bridge between human and divine** not merely symbolically, but *literally*. He knows both realms. He has walked the earth as man and now stands beside the Throne as the highest angel. He is the proof that the distance between Malkuth (Kingdom, the material world) and Kether (Crown, the Godhead) can be traversed.

### The Pattern: Metatron as Supreme Mediator

All traditions about Metatron share a common structure:
1. **Threshold position** (beside the Throne, between created and Uncreated, human turned angel)
2. **Mediating function** (translating divine will, stepping down divine voltage, bearing the Name)
3. **Administrative and recording role** (Chancellor, Scribe of the Akashic Records, witness)
4. **Advocacy for humanity** (sustaining prayers, guiding souls, teaching hidden knowledge)
5. **Proof of apotheosis** (Enoch's transformation demonstrates the soul's capacity for ascension)

Metatron does not descend to intervene in human affairs like Gabriel or Michael. Metatron stands **at the apex**, the ultimate destination of the ascending soul, the first point of contact with the divine. He is the angel who says: *"The journey from Malkuth to Kether is possible. I am the proof. I am the way. Follow."*

## Theological Depth

### Qabalistic Context

In the **Qabalistic Tree of Life**, Metatron is the Archangel of **Kether** (כתר, "Crown"), the first Sephira, positioned at the apex of the Tree. Kether is the **first emanation** from the Ain Soph Aur (the Limitless Light), the point where the infinite becomes finite, where the Unmanifest begins to manifest. It is called the **Ancient of Days** (*Atik Yomin*), the **Primordial Point** (*Nekudah Rishonah*), and the **Smooth Point** (no division, no duality).

**Kether's Attributes:**
- **Divine Name:** Eheieh (אהיה, "I Am" or "I Will Be")—the name God gives to Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3:14)
- **Planetary Sphere:** Primum Mobile (the "First Swirling")—the outermost sphere in Ptolemaic cosmology, the source of all motion
- **Element:** Spirit (the root of Fire, the primal creative spark)
- **Color:** White Brilliance (undifferentiated light containing all colors)
- **Archangel:** Metatron
- **Angelic Choir:** Chaioth ha-Qadesh (Holy Living Creatures, the Seraphim)
- **Human Experience:** The crown chakra (Sahasrara), mystical union, the experience of pure "I Am"

Metatron, as the Archangel of Kether, is the **active intelligence** of divine unity. Where Kether is the *principle* of oneness, Metatron is the *agent* who translates that oneness into the multiplicity of creation. He stands **between the Infinite and the finite**, serving as the **first mediator**.

Davidson writes in *A Dictionary of Angels*:

> *"According to the cabala, Metatron is the angel who led the children of Israel through the wilderness after the Exodus... he is described as the twin brother or half-brother of the angel Sandalphon."*

Metatron is conceived of as the **link between God and man**, the spiritual being nearest to humanity who is yet divine.

This mediating function is critical: without Metatron, the human soul could not approach the Godhead without being annihilated by the intensity of pure divinity. Metatron **steps down the voltage** of divine presence, making it comprehensible, bearable, survivable.

### The Divine Name: Eheieh (I Am)

Eheieh means "I Am" or "I Will Be"—the eternal present tense, the name that refuses definition. When Moses asks God's name at the burning bush (Exodus 3:14), God responds:

> *"Eheieh Asher Eheieh"* — "I Am That I Am" or "I Will Be What I Will Be."

This is the name of **pure being**, existence without attributes. It is the answer to the question *"What is God?"* with the response: **"I Am."** Not "I am this" or "I am that," but simply **"I Am."**

Metatron, as the Archangel of Kether, embodies this name. To encounter Metatron is to encounter the **"I Am"** at the core of your own being—the consciousness that exists before thought, before identity, before form.

### The Four Worlds: Metatron's Function Across Dimensions

In the Qabalistic schema of the **Four Worlds**, Metatron operates across all levels:

**1. Atziluth (Emanation) — The Archetypal World**
Metatron exists as the **principle of divine presence**, the eternal template of the God-in-form. In Atziluth, Metatron is not a "being" but a **function**: the function of translating infinite unity into knowable presence.

**2. Briah (Creation) — The Archangelic World**
Metatron exists as a **distinct intelligence**, the Chancellor of Heaven, the first individuated consciousness. Here he is personal, relatable, invokable—though still beyond ordinary comprehension.

**3. Yetzirah (Formation) — The Angelic World**
Metatron appears in visions, dreams, and mystical experiences as a **figure of light**, the Guide who leads initiates through the Hekhalot (the heavenly palaces). Here he may take quasi-human form, though radiant and overwhelming.

**4. Assiah (Action) — The Material World**
Metatron manifests through **synchronicities, epiphanies, and the experience of pure presence**. He is felt in moments of mystical union, in the sudden knowing of "I Am," in the dissolution of the separate self during deep meditation or near-death experiences.

### The Pillar of Equilibrium

Kether sits at the **apex of the Middle Pillar** (the Pillar of Equilibrium), directly above Tiphareth (Beauty/the Self) and Yesod (Foundation/the Astral). The Middle Pillar represents the **path of consciousness**—the journey of the soul from Malkuth (material existence) to Kether (divine union).

Metatron, as the guardian of Kether, is the **final teacher** on this path. He is the one who says: *"You have come far. You have integrated the Shadow, embraced the Anima/Animus, awakened the Self. Now you must surrender even that. You must die to who you have become, so that you can know who you always were."*

This is the **initiatic function** of Metatron: he demands the ultimate sacrifice—**the sacrifice of the individuated ego into the infinite Self**.

---
### Mystical and Esoteric Tradition

### The Title: Prince of Countenances

Metatron is called the **Prince of Countenances** (*Sar ha-Panim*), a title that signifies his role as the **face** or **presence** of God. In Hebrew mysticism, the *panim* (face) represents the **aspect of God that can be known**, the manifestation of the unknowable. When Moses asks to see God's glory (Exodus 33:18-23), God responds:

> *"You cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live... I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen."*

Metatron, as the Prince of Countenances, is the **closest one can come** to seeing the divine face without obliteration. He is the **reflection** of God's presence, the mirror in which the Divine can be beheld indirectly. To encounter Metatron is to stand in the presence of the Holy of Holies, to approach the Throne itself.

3 Enoch describes Metatron as having **seventy names** ("I have seventy names, corresponding to the seventy tongues of the world"), and as possessing a **body of cosmic proportions**—his height extending from earth to heaven, his form encompassing the entire created universe. This is not to be taken literally but **symbolically**: Metatron is the **totality of creation** as it exists within divine consciousness before it descends into material form.

### The Function: Chancellor, Scribe, and Sustainer

Metatron's roles are manifold:

**1. Chancellor of Heaven**
Metatron is the administrator of the celestial hierarchy, the one who oversees the **governance of the angelic orders** and ensures that divine will is executed throughout the cosmos. He is the **prime minister** of the heavenly court, the first intelligence to whom God communicates decisions, which are then transmitted down the chain of being.

**2. Scribe of the Akashic Records**
Metatron is said to maintain the **Book of Life** (or the Akashic Records), in which every human deed, thought, and intention is recorded. He is the **witness** to all that occurs, the archivist of cosmic memory. In Kabbalistic tradition, he writes with a **quill of fire** on tablets of sapphire.

**3. Sustainer of Mankind**
Jewish mysticism teaches that Metatron **sustains the prayers of humanity**, gathering them and presenting them before the Throne. He is the **advocate** for humankind, the one who intercedes on behalf of souls struggling toward the light.

**4. Guide of Souls**
Metatron is invoked as the guide who leads souls through the afterlife realms, particularly the highest heavens. He is the psychopomp of the celestial journey, the one who teaches the soul how to navigate the seven palaces (*Hekhalot*) and ascend to the divine presence.

**5. Teacher of Hidden Knowledge**
According to Davidson, legend holds that the *Sefer Raziel ha-Malakh* (Book of the Angel Raziel) "finally came into possession of... Enoch (who, it is said, gave it out as his own work i.e., The Book of Enoch)." He is the revealer of esoteric wisdom, the one who instructs initiates in the mysteries of creation, the structure of the Tree of Life, and the nature of the divine names.

---
### Iconography and Symbolism

Metatron is not as frequently depicted in traditional Christian iconography as Michael or Gabriel, but in Jewish mystical art and esoteric traditions, he appears with distinctive attributes:

**1. Metatron's Cube (Modern Sacred Geometry)**
Modern esoteric tradition associates Metatron with a sacred geometric figure called **Metatron's Cube**—a complex pattern formed by connecting the centers of 13 circles (one central, twelve surrounding). Within the Cube are contained all five **Platonic Solids** (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron), representing the foundational geometric structures of the material universe.

**Note:** This association is not found in classical texts (Davidson, Wang, 3 Enoch, Zohar). The traditional Qabalistic geometry at Kether is the **Cube of Space** from the Sepher Yetzirah, which maps the Hebrew alphabet to the six directions (N, S, E, W, up, down), sealing the universe with the Divine Name. "Metatron's Cube" is a **Vibology Synthesis** (modern esoteric interpretation).

**2. The Pillar of Fire**
In mystical visions, Metatron often appears as a **column of white fire** or brilliant light, too intense to behold directly. This reflects his Ketheric nature—pure, undifferentiated radiance.

**3. The Crown**
Metatron may be depicted wearing a **crown of light**, representing Kether. Sometimes the crown bears the Tetragrammaton (יהוה) in Hebrew letters, signifying that the Name is *within* him.

**4. The Book or Scroll**
As the Scribe of Heaven, Metatron is often shown holding a **great book** or **scroll of fire**, upon which the deeds of humanity are written. This is the Akashic Record, the cosmic memory.

**5. Wings Beyond Counting**
3 Enoch describes Metatron as having **seventy-two wings** ("And He caused 72 wings to grow on me, 36 on each side. And each wing was as the whole world"). Davidson also cites this as "36 pairs of wings." This conveys **omnipresence**—his reach extends to all corners of creation.

**6. Human-Angelic Hybrid**
Unique among angels, Metatron may be depicted with **both human and angelic features**, reflecting his origin as Enoch. He is the bridge—the human who became divine.

---
### Function in Divine Economy

Metatron's function in the divine economy is **mediation at the highest level**. The Ain Soph (the Infinite) cannot interact directly with creation—the gap is too vast, the intensity too great. Kether is the **first step-down** of that infinite energy, and Metatron is the **intelligent agent** of that step-down.

**The Descent of Divine Will:**
1. **Ain Soph Aur** (Limitless Light) — Pure potentiality, unmanifest
2. **Kether** (Crown) — First emanation, "I Am," divine unity
3. **Metatron** — The active intelligence that translates divine unity into knowable presence
4. **Chaioth ha-Qadesh** (Seraphim) — The angelic choir that receives and circulates the divine fire
5. **Lower Sephiroth and Angelic Orders** — Progressive densification until the divine will reaches Malkuth (material reality)

Without Metatron, the **chain of being would be broken** at the highest link. He is the **keystone** of the cosmic arch, the intelligence that holds the structure together.

---
### Human Consciousness Parallel
**Vibology Synthesis — Cross-System Integration**

Metatron corresponds to the **Head Center** in Human Design—the center of **existential pressure, inspiration, and the drive to know**. The Head asks the ultimate questions: *"Why am I here? What is the purpose of existence? Who am I truly?"*

These are Metatronic questions. They arise not from the mind (Ajna) but from a **deeper pressure**, a cosmic anxiety that propels the soul toward enlightenment. The Head Center does not seek practical answers—it seeks **truth for its own sake**, regardless of utility.

**Gate 64 (Confusion)** in the Head Center is particularly relevant: it is the pressure of the mind **before** enlightenment, the confusion that precedes clarity. The individual with Gate 64 defined feels **overwhelmed by the multiplicity of reality**, unable to make sense of it all. This confusion is **sacred**—it is the dark night that precedes the dawn, the chaos before the order.

Metatron's teaching to Gate 64 is: *"Stop trying to figure it out. You cannot think your way to God. Surrender the need to know, and you will Know."*

**Gate 61 (Inner Truth)** in the Head Center is the other pole: the capacity for **direct gnosis**, mystical insight that bypasses rational thought. This is Metatronic knowing—the sudden, wordless understanding of *"I Am."*

### Tarot Correspondences

**The Four Aces:** Wang confirms the Four Aces are attributed to Kether—pure potentiality in Fire, Water, Air, and Earth
- **Ace of Wands:** Kether in Fire (primal will, creative spark)
- **Ace of Cups:** Kether in Water (divine love, emotional grace)
- **Ace of Swords:** Kether in Air (pure mind, divine intellect)
- **Ace of Pentacles:** Kether in Earth (divine manifestation, sacred embodiment)

**The Fool (0):** Wang places The Fool on the path descending from Kether, describing it as the "One God Energy" emanating from the source—the divine spark before manifestation, the soul in its pristine state before the descent into form

**Judgment (XX) — Vibology Synthesis:** The resurrection, the apotheosis, the soul's return to divine origin after the cycle of incarnation. (Note: Wang associates Judgment with Archangels Michael and Gabriel, not Metatron. This correspondence is interpretive.)

---
### Elemental Attribution

Metatron governs **Spirit**, the fifth element beyond Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. Spirit is the **undifferentiated essence** from which all elements emerge—the primal creative spark, the divine will before it takes specific form.

In some traditions, Kether is associated with the **root of Fire**—the incandescent whiteness that contains all colors, the burning intensity of pure being. This is not the Fire of passion or transformation (ruled by lower spheres), but the **Fire of existence itself**—the fact that anything exists at all rather than nothing.

To work with Metatron is to work with the **source of manifestation**, the moment before the Big Bang, the white point from which all creation explodes.

---
### Planetary Correspondence

Metatron's planetary attribution is the **Primum Mobile** (Rashith ha-Gilgalim, "beginning of whirling")—the outermost sphere in Ptolemaic cosmology, the **source of all motion** in the cosmos. Wang writes: "The sphere of its [Kether's] operation is called Rashith ha-Gilgalim—the beginning of whirling, the Primum Mobile or First Mover... and its Archangel is the Prince of Countenances—Metatron."

Agrippa confirms: "...flowing through Hajoth Hakados, to the angel Metratton, and to the ministering spirit Reschith Hagalalim, who guides the Primum Mobile, and bestows the gift of being upon all things."

The Primum Mobile is the "First Swirling," the original rotation from which all planetary movements derive. In astrological terms, it corresponds to the **Precession of the Equinoxes**—the slow wobble of Earth's axis over 25,920 years, representing deep cosmic time, the cycles of ages. This is the slowest, vastest movement in the heavens, appropriate for Kether, the most transcendent sphere.

---
### Mythology and Cross-Tradition Parallels

The archetype of the **human-turned-divine** appears across wisdom traditions:

**Greek Mythology:**
- **Heracles (Hercules):** After completing the Twelve Labors and enduring his death, Heracles ascends to Olympus and becomes a god, marrying Hebe (Youth). This is apotheosis through ordeal and service.

**Hindu Tradition:**
- **The Avatars:** Beings like Rama and Krishna are divine incarnations, but the concept of **jivan-mukta** (liberated while living) also parallels Metatron—souls who achieve moksha (liberation) while still embodied, becoming living conduits of Brahman.

**Buddhist Tradition:**
- **The Bodhisattva:** The enlightened being who chooses to remain in the cycle of rebirth to aid others, embodying divine compassion while retaining connection to the human realm.

**Christian Mysticism:**
- **Theosis (Deification):** The Eastern Orthodox teaching that humans are called to become "partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4). Metatron is the ultimate exemplar of theosis—human nature elevated to divine status.

**Gnostic Tradition:**
- **The Divine Human (Anthropos):** The primordial Adam Kadmon, the cosmic human who contains the blueprint of all humanity. Metatron is often identified with this figure.

---
### Jungian and Psychological Dimension
**Vibology Synthesis — Cross-System Integration**

Carl Jung's concept of the **Self** (capital "S"—the totality of the psyche, not the ego) is the closest psychological parallel to Metatron. The Self is the **God-image** within the psyche, the organizing principle that drives individuation, the center that is paradoxically **both within and beyond** the individual.

Jung wrote:

> *"The self is not only the centre but also the whole circumference which embraces both conscious and unconscious; it is the centre of this totality, just as the ego is the centre of consciousness."* (*Aion*, CW 9ii, par. 41)

Metatron, in Jungian terms, is the **archetype of the Self in its most exalted form**—the Self that has fully integrated all aspects of the psyche (Shadow, Anima/Animus, Persona) and now stands at the threshold of **dissolution into the Divine**.

**The Metatronic Process:**
1. **Ego Formation** (childhood/youth): "I am separate, I am distinct"
2. **Shadow Work** (confronting the repressed): "I am more than I thought"
3. **Anima/Animus Integration** (inner marriage): "I am whole"
4. **Self Realization** (the awakened heart): "I am the Self"
5. **Metatronic Dissolution** (apotheosis): "I Am" (no longer "I am this" or "I am that"—just "I Am")

The danger at this stage is **inflation**—the ego identifying *as* the Self and claiming godhood. True Metatronic consciousness is **egoless**—there is no pride, no claim, no "I did it." There is only **presence**, the divine flowing through an empty vessel.

### Psychological and Spiritual Development

Metatron represents the **ultimate stage of individuation** in Jungian terms—the point at which the ego, having integrated the Shadow, the Anima/Animus, and the Self, **dissolves into the Self entirely**. This is not regression to unconsciousness; it is **conscious union** with the divine ground of being.

**Stages of Metatronic Consciousness:**

**1. Recognition ("I am not who I thought I was")**
The individual realizes that all identities—personal, social, archetypal—are **masks**. There is a deeper "I" beneath the roles. This is terrifying and liberating.

**2. Disidentification ("I am not any-thing")**
The ego-structure begins to dissolve. Attachments to outcomes, relationships, achievements, and even spiritual attainments fall away. This is the **dark night**.

**3. The Abyss ("I am nothing")**
The experience of total annihilation. There is no ground, no self, no meaning. This is the crossing of Daath. Many turn back here. Those who do not turn back discover:

**4. Kether ("I Am")**
The realization that **"I Am" is all there is**. Not "I am something" or "I am someone," but simply **"I Am."** This is Eheieh. This is Metatron's teaching. The separate self is gone, but **awareness remains**—pure, radiant, infinite.

**5. Embodiment ("I Am Here")**
The return to the world. The individual who has touched Kether does not disappear into bliss. They **descend** back into Malkuth, but now they carry the light. They live as a **hollow bone** through which divine will flows. This is the Metatronic function: **being the presence** through which the Divine touches the world.

---
### The Gift of Integration

When Metatronic intelligence is integrated (not identified with, but participated in), the individual becomes:

**1. A Living Presence**
The separate self dissolves, but **awareness remains**. The individual becomes a **hollow bone** through which the Divine flows. They do not claim authority—they simply *are* the presence of the sacred.

**2. A Bridge Between Worlds**
Like Metatron himself, the integrated soul becomes a **mediator**—someone who can translate the highest truths into language and action that others can receive. Teachers, mystics, prophets often carry this function.

**3. Egoless Service**
There is no "doer"—only doing. The individual acts, speaks, creates, but there is no attachment to outcome, no pride in accomplishment. It is **pure function**, like a river flowing downhill.

**4. The Witness**
The soul becomes a **witness** to its own life and the lives of others—not judging, not interfering, but **seeing clearly**. This is the Akashic function within consciousness: perfect memory, perfect presence.

**5. The Name Within**
The individual knows their **true name**—not the name given at birth, but the name written in the Book of Life, the name that *is* their essence. To know this name is to know oneself as God knows oneself.

---
### Relationships with Other Archangels

Metatron occupies a unique position in the celestial hierarchy: he is **not part of the nine orders** described by Pseudo-Dionysius, because he exists **above** them. While the nine orders (Seraphim through Angels) mediate divine will through progressively denser levels of manifestation, Metatron stands at the **origin point** where divine will first becomes distinct from the Godhead itself.

### With [[Sandalphon]] (Malkuth)

[[Sandalphon]], Archangel of Malkuth (the Kingdom, material reality), is often called Metatron's "twin" or counterpart. Where Metatron stands at Kether (the highest point), Sandalphon stands at Malkuth (the lowest point). Together they form the **vertical axis** of the Tree—the channel through which divine will descends and human prayers ascend.

Metatron is the **voice of God descending**; Sandalphon is the **prayer of humanity ascending**. One cannot exist without the other. The Crown without the Kingdom is abstraction; the Kingdom without the Crown is meaninglessness.

### The Descent Through the Archangels

From Metatron (Kether), the divine emanation flows through:
- **[[Raziel]]** (Chokmah) — The revealer of divine wisdom
- **[[Tzaphkiel]]** (Binah) — The divine mother who gives form
- **[[Tzadkiel]]** (Chesed) — The lawgiver and mercy-bringer
- **[[Kamael]]** (Gevurah) — The executor of divine judgment
- **[[Raphael]]** (Tiphareth) — The healer and harmonizer
- **[[Haniel]]** (Netzach) — The prince of love and beauty
- **[[Michael]]** (Hod) — The sword of discrimination
- **[[Gabriel]]** (Yesod) — The messenger and dream-bringer
- **[[Sandalphon]]** (Malkuth) — The weaver of prayers

Metatron oversees this entire descent, ensuring that the **chain remains unbroken**, that each Archangel fulfills its function, that the divine will reaches material reality intact.

### A Closing Meditation on Metatron

*Metatron is not separate from you. He is the 'I Am' within you, the part of you that has never forgotten its divine origin. To invoke him is to remember who you were before you were born, and who you will be when all masks fall away.*

## Fallen Aspect

The shadow of Metatron manifests in several dangerous forms:

**1. Spiritual Inflation ("I Am God")**
The ego claims divine identity without having undergone the necessary death. The individual proclaims, "I am enlightened," "I am Metatron," "I am the chosen one," using spiritual language to **inflate the ego** rather than dissolve it.

**Test:** True Metatronic realization produces **humility**, not grandiosity. The awakened soul says, "I Am"—but there is no pride in it, because there is no separate "I" to be proud. The inflated ego says, "I am special, I am enlightened," and demands recognition.

**2. Bypassing Embodiment (Kether Without Malkuth)**
The individual seeks transcendence while **rejecting the body, the material world, the human condition**. They want the Crown without the Kingdom, enlightenment without incarnation. This is not Metatronic—Metatron was **Enoch**, a man who walked the earth before ascending. True apotheosis requires **full embodiment** before transcendence.

**3. Usurping Divine Authority ("Obey Me, For the Name Is In Me")**
The individual claims to speak with divine authority, using Metatron's name or function to **dominate others**. "God told me to tell you..." becomes a tool of manipulation. True Metatronic transmission is **empowering**, not controlling—it reveals the divine *within* the other, not the speaker's power *over* them.

**4. The Demiurge (False God)**
In Gnostic cosmology, the **Demiurge** is the false creator-god who mistakes himself for the true Divine. Some interpretations of Metatron (particularly in Gnostic and anti-Qabalistic polemics) see him as a **Demiurgic figure**—an angel who has overstepped, claiming authority that belongs to God alone. This is the shadow of mediation: the mediator **forgetting** he is not the Source, only the channel.

**5. The Scribe as Judge (Karma Without Mercy)**
Metatron as the Scribe of the Akashic Records can become the **merciless judge**, tallying every transgression without compassion. This is Geburah (Severity) without Chesed (Mercy)—the law without love. True Metatronic record-keeping is **witnessing**, not condemning. The Akashic Record is not a courtroom ledger but a **mirror** in which the soul sees itself clearly.

## Invocation

### 1. Meditation and Contemplation

To meditate on Metatron is to meditate on **the highest possibility of human consciousness**—the capacity to transcend the ego entirely and merge with divine awareness while still retaining individuality. This is the paradox of Kether: it is both **union** (the dissolution of the separate self) and **identity** (the "I Am" that persists even in union).

**Pathworking to Kether via Metatron:**

1. **Begin in Malkuth** (grounded in the body, present to ordinary consciousness).
2. **Ascend the Middle Pillar** through Yesod (the astral threshold), Tiphareth (the heart of the Self), and Daath (the Abyss, the dissolution of all concepts).
3. **Cross the Abyss:** This is the **dark night of the soul**, the shattering of all identity structures, the annihilation of the ego. Without this crossing, Kether cannot be approached. You must be willing to **die to the separate self**.
4. **Enter Kether:** Visualize pure white brilliance, a light so intense it contains all colors yet appears colorless. There is no form here, no image—only **presence**.
5. **Invoke Metatron:** Call upon him not as an external being but as the **highest intelligence within your own soul**—the part of you that has never forgotten its divine origin. Say: *"I Am. I Am That I Am. Eheieh Asher Eheieh."*
6. **Listen for the Name:** Metatron's teaching is the **Tetragrammaton**—the Name that cannot be spoken but can be *known*. Listen for the breath: *Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh* (יהוה). The inbreath and outbreath are the Name itself.
7. **Return:** Descend slowly through Daath, Tiphareth, Yesod, back to Malkuth. Bring the light of Kether into the body. Ground the experience in action.

**Contemplative Question:**
*"Who am I before I am anyone?"*

This is the question of Kether. Before you were given a name, before you were conditioned by family, culture, trauma, desire—**who were you?** Metatron is the answer to that question. He is the "I Am" before all definition.

### 2. Invocation Methods

**Traditional Invocation (Mystical Judaism):**
> *"Metatron, Prince of Countenances, who was Enoch and is the Lesser YHVH, in whose being the Name resides—I stand before you as one seeking the path of return. Show me the way through the seven palaces. Teach me the mysteries of the Chariot. Let me behold the Throne, if I am worthy. Amen."*

**Hermetic Invocation (Qabalistic Magic):**
> *"By the divine name Eheieh, I invoke thee, Metatron, Archangel of Kether, sustainer of the Chaioth ha-Qadesh. Descend upon me with the white brilliance of the Crown. Let thy light dissolve all illusion of separation. Let me know myself as I Am. Let the Name within me awaken. Amen."*

**Personal Invocation for Apotheosis:**
> *"Metatron, you who were human and became divine, show me the way. I do not ask for comfort. I do not ask for power. I ask only for truth—the truth of who I am beyond all masks, all roles, all wounds. Strip away what is false. Reveal what is eternal. Let me walk with God as Enoch walked, that I may be transformed."*

**When to Invoke Metatron:**
- During **mystical death-rebirth experiences** (dark night of the soul, ego dissolution)
- When seeking **knowledge of your true name** or divine purpose
- At the **culmination of a spiritual path**, when all lesser teachings have been exhausted
- When working with **sacred geometry, divine names, or the Tree of Life**
- When preparing to **cross the Abyss** (the initiation beyond the ego)

**WARNING:** Do not invoke Metatron if you are not prepared for profound transformation. His presence demands **total honesty** with yourself. There is no hiding before the Prince of Countenances.

### 3. Signs of Metatronic Presence

- A sudden, overwhelming sense of **"I Am"**—identity stripped of all content
- Visions of **white light, geometric patterns, sacred architecture**
- The feeling of being **witnessed** by an intelligence vaster than self
- Synchronicities involving the **number 72** (Metatron's seventy names), **365** (Enoch's years), or **314** (gematria of Metatron = Shaddai)
- The experience of **ego dissolution** followed by radiant clarity

### 4. How to Cultivate Relationship with Metatron

**1. Practice "I Am" Meditation**
Sit in silence. Breathe naturally. On each inbreath, silently say: *"I."* On each outbreath, silently say: *"Am."* Do not add anything after "Am"—no description, no identity, no story. Just *"I Am."* Feel the resonance of the Name within you.

**2. Study Sacred Geometry (Metatron's Cube)**
Obtain a diagram of Metatron's Cube. Meditate on it. Trace its lines with your finger or your gaze. Contemplate: *"This is the blueprint of all creation. This pattern exists within me, as me, around me."*

**3. Work the Middle Pillar (Qabalistic Exercise)**
Visualize the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life running through your body:
- **Kether** (Crown) — White brilliance above your head
- **Daath** (Abyss) — Emptiness at your throat
- **Tiphareth** (Heart) — Golden sun at your heart
- **Yesod** (Foundation) — Silver moon at your pelvis
- **Malkuth** (Kingdom) — Earth beneath your feet

Breathe light from Kether down to Malkuth, and from Malkuth back up to Kether. Invoke Metatron at the Crown: *"Let the light descend and ascend. Let me be the pillar through which heaven and earth meet."*

**4. Contemplate Enoch's Translation**
Read Genesis 5:24 slowly. Ask: *"What does it mean to 'walk with God'? How does one live in such alignment that transformation becomes inevitable?"* Journal your reflections.

**5. Invoke Metatron at Thresholds**
Metatron is the guide of the greatest threshold—the passage from human to divine. Invoke him during life's major transitions: births, deaths, marriages, initiations, dark nights, ego deaths. Say: *"Metatron, guide me across this threshold. Let me not cling to what I was. Let me trust what I am becoming."*
