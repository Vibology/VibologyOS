## Overview

The **Four Archangels of the Quarters** are the four great archangels invoked as guardians of the elemental directions in Western ceremonial magic, most notably in the **Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram** ([[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]]):

| Direction | Archangel | Element | Color | Quality |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|---------|
| **East** | [[Raphael]] | Air | Yellow | Healing, intellect, dawn |
| **South** | [[Michael]] | Fire | Red | Protection, will, noon |
| **West** | [[Gabriel]] | Water | Blue | Emotion, intuition, dusk |
| **North** | [[Uriel]] | Earth | Green/Black | Stability, manifestation, midnight |

## The LBRP Invocation

In the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, after tracing the pentagrams at each quarter, the practitioner stands in the center and declares:

> *"Before me, Raphael. Behind me, Gabriel. On my right hand, Michael. On my left hand, Uriel. For about me flames the Pentagram, and in the column stands the six-rayed Star."*

This invocation establishes the four archangels as **protective guardians** of sacred space, creating a balanced temple of the elements.
