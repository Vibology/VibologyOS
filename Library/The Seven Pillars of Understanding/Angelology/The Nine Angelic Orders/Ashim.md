## Overview

**Ashim** (Hebrew: אשים, "Souls of Fire" or "Flames") is the angelic order associated with **[[Malkuth]]** (Kingdom), the tenth Sephirah on the Tree of Life. Also known as **Ishim** in some traditions, this order represents the angels closest to the material world—the divine sparks that animate physical existence.

The Ashim are sometimes identified with the "men of fire" or the blessed souls who have achieved angelic status. They serve as the bridge between the celestial hierarchies and embodied humanity, carrying prayers upward and divine blessings downward.

In the Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchy, this order corresponds roughly to the **[[Angels]]** (ninth order), the messengers and guardians who interact most directly with human beings.
