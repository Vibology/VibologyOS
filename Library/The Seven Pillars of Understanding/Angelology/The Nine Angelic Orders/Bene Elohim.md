## Overview

**Bene Elohim** (Hebrew: בני אלהים, "Sons of God" or "Children of the Gods") is the angelic order associated with **[[Hod]]** (Splendor), the eighth Sephirah on the Tree of Life. This order embodies the intellectual and communicative aspects of divine manifestation—the angels of knowledge, magic, and ceremonial form.

The term *Bene Elohim* appears in Genesis 6:2-4, where the "sons of God" saw the daughters of men and took wives among them. In Qabalistic angelology, however, the Bene Elohim represent the **mercurial intelligences**—angels of learning, language, and the transmission of divine wisdom through structured form.

In the Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchy, this order corresponds to the **[[Archangels]]** (eighth order), the great messengers who communicate divine decrees to humanity.
