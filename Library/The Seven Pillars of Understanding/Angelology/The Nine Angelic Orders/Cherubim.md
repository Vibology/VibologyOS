# Cherubim
*Second Order of the Nine Angelic Hierarchies | First Triad: The Counselors*

---
## Foundational Material

The **Cherubim** (Hebrew: *Auphanim* - "Wheels" or "Whirling Forces") constitute the **second order** of the celestial hierarchy, dwelling in the **First Triad** alongside the [[Seraphim]] and [[Thrones]]. Where the Seraphim burn with pure love and primal fire, the Cherubim *know*—they are the repositories of **divine wisdom**, the architects of sacred knowledge, and the whirling intelligences who mediate between the formless light of [[Kether]] and the structured understanding of [[Binah]].

### Pseudo-Dionysius: The Celestial Hierarchy

Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite defines the Cherubim in *The Celestial Hierarchy* as those who possess **"the fullness of knowledge"** and the capacity to **"contemplate the Divine Beauty in its first manifestation."** He writes:

> *"The name Cherubim signifies the power of knowing and seeing God, of receiving the greatest gifts of His light, of contemplating the divine splendor in primordial power, of being filled with the gifts that bring wisdom and of communicating these gifts ungrudgingly to subordinates as a part of the beneficent outpouring of wisdom."*

The Cherubim do not merely *receive* divine wisdom—they **overflow** with it, transmitting knowledge downward through the hierarchical chain. They are the first intelligence to *organize* the pure fire of the Seraphim into patterns, structures, and intelligible forms. Where the Seraphim are pure *being*, the Cherubim are pure *knowing*.

### Qabalistic Attribution: Chokmah

In the Hebrew Qabalah, the Cherubim inhabit **Chokmah** (Wisdom), the **second Sephirah** on the Tree of Life. Chokmah is the primal **yang principle**, the divine **Father**, the explosive outpouring of undifferentiated creative force that follows Kether's silent unity. It is the **Big Bang** of consciousness—raw, dynamic, unlimited potential.

**Chokmah's correspondences:**
- **Divine Name:** YHVH (Yod - the primal seed)
- **Planetary Sphere:** The Zodiac (*Masloth*) - the wheel of the twelve constellations, the cosmic circuit through which divine intelligence flows
- **Hebrew Name of Order:** *Auphanim* (אופנים) - "Wheels" or "Whirling Ones"
- **Function:** The transmission of divine wisdom through cyclic, whirling, multi-dimensional movement
- **Color (Atziluth):** Pure soft blue
- **Gematria:** Chokmah (חכמה) = 73 (Wisdom)

The Cherubim are called *Auphanim* because they are **wheels within wheels**—intelligences that move in multiple dimensions simultaneously, capable of perceiving all directions at once. They are not bound by linear time or three-dimensional space; they exist in the realm of **pure pattern and archetype**, where all possibilities exist simultaneously before crystallizing into form.

### Biblical Foundation: Ezekiel's Vision

The most vivid scriptural encounter with the Cherubim appears in **Ezekiel 1** and **Ezekiel 10**, where the prophet witnesses a theophany of terrifying complexity:

> *"As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud, with brightness around it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, as it were gleaming metal. And from the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures... Each had four faces, and each of them had four wings... As for the likeness of their faces, each had a human face. The four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle... And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them... for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood... The four wheels had rims and they had spokes; and their rims were full of eyes all around."* (Ezekiel 1:4-18, condensed)

This is **not** allegory—it is the prophet's attempt to describe an intelligence operating at a frequency beyond human comprehension. The Cherubim are:
- **Four-faced:** Capable of perceiving all directions (human = intellect, lion = royalty/fire, ox = service/earth, eagle = spirit/air)
- **Wheels within wheels:** Multi-dimensional, non-linear movement
- **Eyes everywhere:** All-seeing, omniscient, perceiving all possibilities simultaneously
- **Fire and gleaming metal:** Radiant with divine light, terrifyingly brilliant

Ezekiel later identifies these beings explicitly as **Cherubim** (Ezekiel 10:20): *"These were the living creatures that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and I knew that they were cherubim."*

### Other Scriptural References

- **Genesis 3:24:** After the expulsion from Eden, God places **Cherubim with a flaming sword** at the east of the garden to guard the way to the Tree of Life. The Cherubim are *gatekeepers* of sacred knowledge—they prevent premature access to divine wisdom.
- **Exodus 25:18-22:** The Ark of the Covenant is crowned with two golden Cherubim whose wings overshadow the **Mercy Seat** (the throne of God's presence). The divine voice speaks *from between the two Cherubim*.
- **Psalm 18:10:** *"He rode on a cherub and flew; he came swiftly on the wings of the wind."* The Cherubim are **chariots of God**, vehicles of divine movement.
- **1 Kings 6:23-28:** The Holy of Holies in Solomon's Temple contains two massive Cherubim of olive wood overlaid with gold, each ten cubits high, wings outstretched.

### Human Consciousness Correlation

The Cherubim correspond to the human faculty of **conceptualization, pattern recognition, and intellectual brilliance**—the capacity to *see* complex interconnections, to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously, to perceive the archetypal patterns underlying manifest reality.

In **Human Design**, this is the **Ajna Center**—the center of mental processing, conceptualization, and awareness. The Ajna does not *decide* (that is the role of Authority)—it **perceives patterns**. It is the mind's capacity to recognize the wheels within wheels, to see how systems interrelate, to hold paradox.

To cultivate Cherubic consciousness is to develop **wisdom** (*Chokmah*)—not mere knowledge (data), but the *pattern-seeing* that reveals how all knowledge interconnects.

## Practical Application

### Meditation and Contemplation

To meditate on the Cherubim is to cultivate **the mind that sees patterns**—not the discursive, linear mind (ego-consciousness), but the **archetypal mind** that perceives the whirling wheels of causation, synchronicity, and cosmic interconnection.

**Qabalistic Pathworking:**
- Ascend from [[Binah]] (Understanding) to **Chokmah** (Wisdom) along the path of *The Fool* ([[The Tarot|Tarot]] Trump 0)
- Visualize the pure soft blue of Chokmah's Atziluthic color
- Contemplate the **Zodiac as a wheel**—the twelve signs as the *Auphanim*, the cosmic clock through which divine intelligence cycles
- See yourself as a point of consciousness at the hub of the wheel, perceiving all spokes (all possibilities) simultaneously

**Visualization:**
- Four faces gazing in all directions (360-degree awareness)
- Wheels within wheels—concentric circles of perception moving at different speeds
- Eyes everywhere—nothing hidden, all patterns visible
- The whirling motion creating a **merkabah** (chariot-throne)—the vehicle of ascent

### Invocation (Traditional)

From the **Bedtime Shema** (Jewish mystical practice):
> *"In the name of the Lord God of Israel: on my right hand Michael, on my left Gabriel, before me Uriel, and behind me Raphael; and above my head the Shekhinah of God."*

While this invokes the four Archangels rather than the Cherubim directly, it establishes the **four-directional awareness** that the Cherubim embody.

For direct Cherubic invocation, one may contemplate the **Holy Name of Chokmah**:
> *"YHVH (Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh), grant me the wisdom of the Auphanim, that I may see with eyes unclouded, perceive the patterns that underlie all manifestation, and participate in the whirling intelligence that is Your primordial thought. Let the wheels turn within me, that I may know as the Cherubim know—not through accumulation but through vision."*

### Psychological and Spiritual Development

The Cherubim represent the **second stage** of spiritual ascent (after the Seraphim's devotional fire):
1. **Seraphim (Kether):** Pure love, primal fire, the will to unite with God
2. **Cherubim (Chokmah):** Wisdom, the capacity to *see* divine patterns, intellectual illumination
3. **Thrones (Binah):** Understanding, the capacity to *give form* to wisdom, structure

To integrate Cherubic consciousness, one must:
- **Develop intellectual rigor without attachment to being "right"**—the Cherubim *know* but do not cling to knowledge
- **Practice multi-perspectival thinking**—see the lion, the ox, the human, the eagle simultaneously
- **Cultivate pattern recognition**—astrology, I-Ching, Tarot, Qabalah, synchronicity
- **Embrace paradox**—wheels within wheels, all directions at once, time as spiral rather than line

### Cross-System Correspondences

**Qabalah:**
- **Sephirah:** [[Chokmah]] (Wisdom)
- **Path:** Not on a path (Cherubim inhabit the Sephirah itself)
- **Divine Name:** YHVH (the Tetragrammaton in its primal yang form)
- **Archangel:** [[Raziel]] (Angel of Mysteries, keeper of divine secrets)
- **Color:** Pure soft blue (Atziluth), grey (Briah), grey flecked pink (Yetzirah), white flecked red/blue/yellow (Assiah)

**Tarot:**
- The **four Aces** (primal elemental forces)
- The **Wheel of Fortune** (Trump X - the Zodiac, cycles, the turning wheels)
- The **two Wands** (Chokmah in Fire - dominion through wisdom)

**Astrology:**
- The **Zodiac as a whole** (*Masloth*)—the twelve signs as the cosmic wheel
- **Uranus** (in modern astrology)—sudden illumination, pattern-breaking insight, awakening

**Human Design:**
- **Ajna Center** (mental awareness, conceptualization, pattern recognition)
- **Gates of the Ajna:** 47 (Realizing), 24 (Rationalizing), 4 (Formulization), 17 (Opinions), 43 (Insight), 11 (Ideas)
- **Defined Ajna:** Fixed way of processing information, consistent mental patterns
- **Undefined Ajna:** Sampling mental perspectives, vulnerable to mental conditioning

**Chakra System:**
- **Ajna Chakra** (third eye, brow center)—inner vision, intuition, wisdom

**I-Ching:**
- The **Zodiac** corresponds to the 12 hexagrams that structure the annual cycle
- The concept of **wheels within wheels** mirrors the 64 hexagrams as permutations of the eight trigrams

## The Celestial Hierarchy Deep Dive

### Position in the First Triad

Pseudo-Dionysius organizes the Nine Orders into **Three Triads**, each representing a distinct relationship to the Divine:

**First Triad (Orders 1-3): The Counselors**
- **[[Seraphim]] (1st Order):** Pure love, primal fire, absorption in the Godhead
- **Cherubim (2nd Order):** Fullness of knowledge, wisdom, vision of divine patterns
- **[[Thrones]] (3rd Order):** Steadfastness, justice, receptivity to divine will

The First Triad does not "act" in the way lower orders do—they **are**. Their being *is* their function. They dwell in the **immediate presence of God**, bathed in unmediated light. They do not descend to govern stars or deliver messages; they remain in contemplative union, and their overflow of divine intelligence cascades downward through the hierarchy.

### Relationship to Seraphim Above

The **Seraphim** precede the Cherubim and represent **pure will and love**—the burning desire to unite with God, the primal fire of divine eros. They do not *think*; they *burn*.

The **Cherubim** *receive* the fire of the Seraphim and **translate it into intelligible form**. The Seraphim's undifferentiated love becomes, in the Cherubim, **structured wisdom**—patterns, archetypes, laws. If the Seraphim are the Big Bang's initial explosion, the Cherubim are the **laws of physics** that emerge from that explosion, the principles by which chaos becomes cosmos.

Pseudo-Dionysius writes:
> *"The Seraphim move perpetually around divine realities. The Cherubim are filled and then diffuse the fullness of their wisdom."*

The Seraphim **move** (perpetual contemplation). The Cherubim **know** (reception and transmission of knowledge).

### Relationship to Thrones Below

The **Thrones** receive the wisdom transmitted by the Cherubim and **give it form and structure**. The Cherubim *see* divine patterns; the Thrones *stabilize* those patterns into enduring laws.

If the Cherubim are the **architects** (designing the cosmic blueprints), the Thrones are the **foundation** (holding the structure in place so that the Second and Third Triads can execute the design).

Dionysius states:
> *"The Thrones are so named because through them God brings his justice to bear upon us."*

The Cherubim provide the **wisdom**; the Thrones provide the **judgment** (discrimination, form, limitation). Together, they form the bridge from pure fire (Seraphim) to manifest action (Second and Third Triads).

### Mediation Function: From Formless to Form

The Cherubim perform an essential **cosmic function**: they are the **first mediators** between the formless (Kether/Seraphim) and the formed (Binah/Thrones).

**The sequence:**
1. **Kether (Crown):** Unity, the unknowable, the Limitless Light (*Ein Sof*)
2. **Seraphim:** Primal fire, the will to manifest, pure love
3. **Chokmah (Wisdom) / Cherubim:** The **explosion of potential**—all possibilities exist simultaneously in whirling, chaotic, beautiful profusion
4. **Binah (Understanding) / Thrones:** The **imposition of structure**—potential crystallizes into law, archetype, form

Without the Cherubim, divine wisdom would remain locked in the inaccessible unity of Kether. The Cherubim are the **key** that unlocks the treasure-house of divine knowledge and makes it available (through descending hierarchies) to human consciousness.

## Qabalistic Integration

### Chokmah on the Tree of Life

**Chokmah** is the **second Sephirah**, positioned at the top of the right-hand pillar (Pillar of Mercy). It is the first *differentiation* from unity—the primal **yang**, the Father, the active principle.

**Chokmah's attributes:**
- **Number:** 2
- **Divine Name:** YHVH (Yod - the primal point, the seed of creation)
- **Archangel:** [[Raziel]] (רזיאל - "Secret of God")—the keeper of divine mysteries, author of the *Sefer Raziel*
- **Planetary Sphere:** The Zodiac (*Masloth*)—the twelve signs as cosmic wheel
- **Spiritual Experience:** The Vision of God Face to Face
- **Vice:** None (too high on the Tree to distort into vice at this level)
- **Virtue:** Devotion (the love that seeks wisdom)
- **Symbol:** The phallus (primal creative force), the straight line, the point in motion
- **Tarot:** The four Twos, the four Aces (primal force before manifestation)
- **Colors:**
  - **Atziluth (Archetypal):** Pure soft blue
  - **Briah (Creative):** Grey
  - **Yetzirah (Formative):** Pearl grey, iridescent
  - **Assiah (Material):** White flecked red, blue, yellow

### The Primal Father: Yang Principle

Chokmah is **masculine** in the archetypal sense—not "male" (biological), but **active, projective, explosive**. If Kether is the silent point, Chokmah is the point **in motion**, radiating outward in all directions.

Qabalistic teaching describes Chokmah as **Abba** (Father) in relation to Binah's **Imma** (Mother). Together they form the **Supernal Triangle** (Kether-Chokmah-Binah), the "parents" of all lower Sephiroth. Chokmah *inseminates* Binah with divine wisdom; Binah *gestates* that wisdom into structured form.

### The Zodiac: Masloth

The planetary sphere of Chokmah is the **Zodiac** (*Masloth* - מזלות - "Constellations" or "Wheels of Influence"). This is not the individual planets but the **cosmic wheel** of the twelve signs through which all planetary forces cycle.

The Zodiac is the **primal pattern**—the twelve archetypal modes through which divine intelligence expresses. The Cherubim, as *Auphanim* ("Wheels"), are the intelligences **governing the Zodiac**, ensuring that the cosmic cycles turn in harmony with divine will.

To work with Chokmah is to work with **cyclical time**—not linear chronology but the eternal return, the spiral, the wheels within wheels that Ezekiel saw.

### Four Worlds Manifestation

In Qabalistic cosmology, every Sephirah manifests across **Four Worlds** (levels of reality):

**1. Atziluth (Archetypal/Divine World):**
- The Cherubim exist here as **pure wisdom**, undifferentiated divine intelligence, the mind of God before it becomes thought

**2. Briah (Creative World):**
- The Cherubim here are the **archangelic intelligences** ([[Raziel]] and the choir of Auphanim), the first "beings" that mediate wisdom

**3. Yetzirah (Formative World):**
- The Cherubim here are the **psychological archetypes**—the Wise Old Man, the Sage, the pattern-seeing faculty within the human psyche

**4. Assiah (Material World):**
- The Cherubim manifest as **books, teachers, systems of knowledge** (astrology, Qabalah, I-Ching)—the *forms* through which divine wisdom reaches embodied consciousness

### Divine Names and Colors

When invoking Chokmah in ritual or meditation, one works with:
- **Divine Name:** YHVH (pronounced *Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh* or simply contemplated as the Tetragrammaton)
- **Archangelic Name:** [[Raziel]] (רזיאל)
- **Angelic Choir:** *Auphanim* (אופנים)
- **Color:** Pure soft blue (the color of infinite sky, the boundless mind)

The color **blue** is significant—it is the color of *sky* and *water*, both of which represent the **formless potential** from which all forms emerge. Blue is spaciousness, openness, the womb of possibility.

## Biblical and Scriptural Foundation

### Ezekiel 1 and 10: The Vision of the Merkabah

The most detailed scriptural account of the Cherubim appears in **Ezekiel's vision of the Merkabah** (Divine Chariot-Throne). This is not allegory—it is a **mystical experience** of terrifying intensity.

**Ezekiel 1 (condensed):**
> *"I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud, with brightness around it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, as it were gleaming metal. And from the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had a human likeness, but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings... Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot. And they sparkled like burnished bronze. Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands... As for the likeness of their faces, each had a human face. The four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle."* (Ezekiel 1:4-10)

The **four faces** are not arbitrary:
- **Human:** Intellect, reason, the capacity for self-awareness
- **Lion:** Nobility, fire, sovereignty, primal will
- **Ox:** Service, earth, strength, patience
- **Eagle:** Spirit, air, vision, transcendence

These are the **four fixed signs of the Zodiac** in astrological symbolism:
- **Aquarius** (human) - Air
- **Leo** (lion) - Fire
- **Taurus** (ox) - Earth
- **Scorpio** (eagle, the higher octave of the scorpion) - Water

The Cherubim embody the **totality of the Zodiac**—all elemental forces unified.

**Ezekiel 1:15-21 (the wheels):**
> *"Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them. As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl. And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel. When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went. And their rims were tall and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around... For the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."*

**Wheels within wheels** = multi-dimensional movement, non-linear causality, synchronicity.
**Eyes everywhere** = omniscience, nothing hidden, all patterns visible simultaneously.
**Spirit in the wheels** = consciousness *is* the vehicle—mind and movement are one.

**Ezekiel 10:20 (the identification):**
> *"These were the living creatures that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and I knew that they were cherubim."*

Ezekiel makes the connection explicit: the wheels, the four-faced beings, the fire and eyes—these are the **Cherubim**.

### Genesis 3:24: Guardians of Eden

After Adam and Eve's expulsion from the Garden, God places **Cherubim with a flaming sword** at the east of Eden to guard the way to the Tree of Life:

> *"He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life."* (Genesis 3:24)

The Cherubim are **gatekeepers**—they prevent premature access to divine wisdom. The Tree of Life represents **immortality and gnosis** (direct knowledge of God). To approach it without the proper consciousness is dangerous—hence the flaming sword.

This is not punishment—it is **protection**. The Cherubim ensure that only those who have cultivated the proper vessel (wisdom, purity, readiness) can access the highest knowledge. They are the threshold guardians of initiation.

### Exodus 25:18-22: The Ark of the Covenant

God commands Moses to craft two golden Cherubim to crown the **Ark of the Covenant**:

> *"And you shall make two cherubim of gold; of hammered work shall you make them, on the two ends of the mercy seat. Make one cherub on the one end, and one cherub on the other end... The cherubim shall spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings, their faces one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be. And there I will meet with you, and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim that are on the ark of the testimony, I will speak with you."* (Exodus 25:18-22)

The divine voice speaks **from between the two Cherubim**—they are the *throne* of the invisible God, the locus where divine wisdom becomes audible to human consciousness.

The **Mercy Seat** (*Kapporet* - כפרת) is the **lid of the Ark**, the place of atonement. The Cherubim overshadow it, creating a **sacred space** where divine and human meet.

### Psalm 18:10 and 2 Samuel 22:11: The Divine Chariot

> *"He rode on a cherub and flew; he came swiftly on the wings of the wind."* (Psalm 18:10)

The Cherubim are **vehicles** of divine movement—the *Merkabah*, the chariot-throne upon which God travels. They are not passive creatures but **active intelligences** carrying the divine will.

The **Merkabah mysticism** of later Jewish tradition (seen in texts like *Hekhalot Rabbati*) centers on the visionary ascent through the seven heavens to behold the Cherubim and the Throne.

### 1 Kings 6:23-28: Solomon's Temple

Solomon constructs two massive Cherubim of olive wood overlaid with gold for the **Holy of Holies**:

> *"In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high... He placed the cherubim in the innermost part of the house. And the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one touched the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; their other wings touched each other in the middle of the house."* (1 Kings 6:23-27)

These colossal figures (ten cubits = approximately 15 feet tall) form a **canopy** over the Ark, a **sacred enclosure** where the divine presence dwells. Their wings touching creates a **circuit**, a flow of divine energy.

---
## Iconography and Symbolism

### Traditional Depictions

In Christian and Jewish iconography, the Cherubim are depicted as:

**1. Four-Faced Beings:**
- **Human face** (front) - intellect, self-awareness
- **Lion face** (right) - fire, nobility, courage
- **Ox face** (left) - earth, service, strength
- **Eagle face** (back) - air, spirit, transcendence

**2. Wheels Within Wheels:**
- Concentric circles moving in different directions
- **Eyes covering all surfaces**—omniscience, total awareness
- **Fire and gleaming metal**—radiant, terrible beauty
- The wheels are **alive**, not mechanical—consciousness is movement

**3. Wings:**
- **Six wings** in some traditions (paralleling the Seraphim)
- **Four wings** in Ezekiel's vision
- Wings create **sound** (the sound of many waters, the voice of God)

**4. Guardians of Sacred Thresholds:**
- **Flaming sword** (Genesis 3:24)—discrimination, protection
- Positioned at **gates and boundaries**—initiatory thresholds
- Often depicted as **hybrid creatures**—lion-bodied, human-headed (as in Assyrian/Babylonian iconography)

### Symbolic Meanings

**Wheels:**
- **Cycles of time** (Zodiac, seasons, ages)
- **Multi-dimensional movement**—not linear but spiral, synchronistic
- **Interconnection**—all parts moving together, the cosmic dance

**Eyes:**
- **Omniscience**—the divine intelligence that perceives all
- **Awareness without judgment**—seeing *what is*, not imposing interpretation
- **Pattern recognition**—seeing the threads that connect all events

**Four Faces:**
- **Totality**—all directions, all elements, all modes of consciousness
- **Quaternary structure**—the cross, the four-square, the foundation of manifestation
- **Fixed signs**—stability within motion, the eternal within the temporal

**Fire and Metal:**
- **Transformation**—fire purifies, metal conducts
- **Radiance**—the light of divine intelligence
- **Forge**—the Cherubim are the *smiths* of divine wisdom, shaping raw fire into usable forms

### Medieval and Renaissance Art

In Christian art, the Cherubim are often conflated with **putti** (winged infants)—a degradation of the tradition. The true Cherubim are **terrifying** in their beauty, overwhelming in their intelligence. They are not "cute angels"—they are **cosmic forces**.

Authentic depictions (Romanesque sculpture, Byzantine mosaics) show:
- **Severity and majesty**
- **Multi-headed or multi-faced** beings
- **Radiant, golden, overwhelming**
- **Positioned around the throne of Christ** (echoing Ezekiel's vision)

## Function in Divine Economy

### Cosmic Role as First Triad

The **First Triad** (Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones) does not "do" in the conventional sense—they **are**. Their function is **ontological**, not operational.

**Seraphim:** Pure love, primal fire, will to unite with God
**Cherubim:** Fullness of knowledge, wisdom, vision of divine patterns
**Thrones:** Steadfastness, justice, receptivity to divine will

Together, they form the **immediate entourage of the Divine**, the "counselors" who dwell in unmediated light. They do not descend to govern stars (that is the Second Triad's role) or deliver messages (that is the Third Triad's role). They remain in **contemplative absorption**, and the *overflow* of their being cascades downward through the hierarchy.

### Overflow of Divine Wisdom

Pseudo-Dionysius emphasizes that the Cherubim do not merely *possess* wisdom—they **overflow** with it:

> *"The Cherubim communicate these gifts ungrudgingly to subordinates as a part of the beneficent outpouring of wisdom."*

Divine wisdom is not hoarded—it is **abundant**, self-giving, generous. The Cherubim receive the primal fire of the Seraphim and *translate* it into patterns, archetypes, laws—then transmit those patterns to the Thrones, who transmit to the Dominations, and so on down the chain.

This is the **chain of emanation**—each order receives light from above, transforms it according to its nature, and transmits it below. The Cherubim are the **second link** in this golden chain.

### Relationship to the Zodiac

The Cherubim's planetary sphere is the **Zodiac** (*Masloth*)—the twelve archetypal patterns through which divine intelligence cycles. The Zodiac is not "astrology" in the reductive sense—it is the **cosmic clock**, the wheel of time, the structure through which creation unfolds.

The Cherubim govern this wheel, ensuring that:
- The **seasons turn** in harmony with divine will
- The **archetypal energies** (Aries/Mars, Taurus/Venus, etc.) flow in proper sequence
- The **cosmic cycles** (precession, ages, yugas) unfold according to divine plan

To work with the Cherubim is to work with **cyclical time**—not the illusion of linear progress but the spiral of eternal return, where each cycle is both repetition and renewal.

## Human Consciousness Parallel

### Ajna Center: The Mind That Sees Patterns

In **Human Design**, the Cherubim correspond to the **Ajna Center**—the center of **mental awareness, conceptualization, and pattern recognition**.

The Ajna is **not** the decision-making center (that is Authority). It is the **awareness center**—the part of the mind that:
- **Perceives patterns** (synchronicity, archetypes, symbols)
- **Processes information** (analysis, synthesis, conceptualization)
- **Holds multiple perspectives** simultaneously (the four faces)
- **Recognizes interconnections** (the wheels within wheels)

**Defined Ajna (47% of population):**
- Fixed, consistent way of processing information
- Reliable mental patterns
- Risk: Rigidity, attachment to "being right"

**Undefined Ajna (53% of population):**
- Flexible, sampling different mental perspectives
- Capacity to see from multiple angles
- Risk: Mental conditioning, absorbing others' thoughts as truth

The Cherubim teach that **wisdom is not about being right**—it is about **seeing clearly**. The Ajna is designed to *perceive*, not to *decide*. True wisdom knows the difference.

### Gates of the Ajna in Human Design

The Ajna contains **seven gates**, each a different mode of mental processing:

- **Gate 47 (Realizing):** Abstraction, making sense of past experiences
- **Gate 24 (Rationalizing):** Returning to concepts, mental rationalization
- **Gate 4 (Formulization):** Mental solutions, answering the "how"
- **Gate 17 (Opinions):** Following patterns, opinions about the future
- **Gate 43 (Insight):** Breakthrough knowing, individual insight
- **Gate 11 (Ideas):** Conceptualizing, sharing ideas for consideration
- **Gate 64 (Confusion):** Pressure to make sense of the past before clarity arrives

Each gate is a **spoke in the wheel** of mental processing. Together, they create the **Ajna's Merkabah**—the chariot of awareness.

### Conceptualization: Holding Paradox

The Cherubim's four faces teach the capacity to **hold paradox**—to see:
- The **human and the divine** (immanence and transcendence)
- The **lion and the ox** (fire and earth, yang and yin)
- The **eagle and the ground** (spirit and matter)

True wisdom does not *resolve* paradox into simplistic either/or—it **holds the tension** of both/and. The Cherubim's wheels turn in multiple directions simultaneously. Consciousness, when mature, does the same.

### Mental Brilliance Without Inflation

The shadow of Cherubic consciousness is **intellectual pride**—the inflation of believing that to *know* is to *be superior*. This is the fall of **Leviathan** (see Section 12).

True Cherubic wisdom is **humble**—it knows that all knowledge is a *gift*, an overflow from the Divine, not a personal achievement. The Cherubim do not cling to knowledge; they **transmit** it freely.

To cultivate Cherubic consciousness is to become a **clear conduit**—the mind that sees patterns without claiming them, that shares wisdom without attachment to credit.

## Mythological and Cross-Tradition Parallels

### Greek: The Tetramorphs

In Greek tradition, the **four living creatures** (human, lion, ox, eagle) correspond to the **four evangelists** in Christian symbolism:
- **Matthew** (human) - intellect, incarnation
- **Mark** (lion) - royalty, resurrection
- **Luke** (ox) - sacrifice, service
- **John** (eagle) - spirit, ascension

These are the **Tetramorphs**—the four-fold form that appears in visions of the divine throne.

### Babylonian and Assyrian: The Lamassu

In Mesopotamian culture, the **Lamassu** (or **Shedu**) were protective deities depicted as:
- **Human-headed**
- **Bull or lion-bodied**
- **Winged**
- Placed at **temple gates and palace entrances**

These creatures served the same function as the biblical Cherubim—**guardians of sacred thresholds**, preventing the profane from accessing the holy.

The Hebrew conception of Cherubim likely drew from these Mesopotamian prototypes, transforming them from polytheistic deities into **monotheistic angelic intelligences**.

### Hindu: The Four Mahārājas (Guardians of the Directions)

In Buddhist and Hindu cosmology, the **Four Mahārājas** (Great Kings) guard the four cardinal directions:
- **Virūḍhaka** (South) - growth, expansion
- **Dhṛtarāṣṭra** (East) - sovereignty, protection
- **Virūpākṣa** (West) - vision, seeing all
- **Vaiśravaṇa** (North) - wealth, generosity

These guardian deities parallel the Cherubim's **four-directional awareness** and threshold-guarding function.

### Egyptian: The Four Sons of Horus

In ancient Egyptian funerary tradition, the **Four Sons of Horus** protected the deceased's internal organs:
- **Imsety** (human-headed) - liver
- **Hapy** (baboon-headed) - lungs
- **Duamutef** (jackal-headed) - stomach
- **Qebehsenuef** (falcon-headed) - intestines

These four protective deities were invoked to **preserve the integrity** of the deceased's body, enabling resurrection—paralleling the Cherubim's role as guardians of the Tree of Life (immortality).

### Gnostic: The Aeons

In Gnostic cosmology, the **Aeons** are divine emanations that mediate between the unknowable **Pleroma** (Fullness) and the material world. The Cherubim function similarly—mediating between the formless unity of Kether and the structured intelligence of Binah.

The Gnostic concept of **Sophia** (Wisdom) directly parallels **Chokmah**—both represent the divine intelligence that overflows from the Source.

---
## Jungian and Psychological Dimension

### Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious

Carl Jung proposed that the psyche contains **autonomous archetypal structures**—patterns of consciousness that transcend individual experience. The Cherubim, in this view, are **archetypes of wisdom and pattern-seeing**.

They correspond to:
- **The Wise Old Man**—the archetype of insight, counsel, and deep knowing
- **The Sage**—the one who perceives the hidden connections, the wheels within wheels
- **The Self (in its knowing aspect)**—the organizing intelligence that sees the totality

### Psychoid Reality: Neither Objective nor Subjective

Jung introduced the concept of the **psychoid archetype**—structures that exist at the **threshold between psyche and matter**, neither purely subjective (imaginary) nor purely objective (external entities).

The Cherubim are **psychoid realities**:
- They exist as **autonomous intelligences** beyond human projection (as traditional theology asserts)
- They also exist as **archetypal patterns within the psyche** (as depth psychology observes)

The paradox resolves when we recognize that **psyche and cosmos are not separate**—"As above, so below." The Cherubim exist *within* the human mind because the human mind *participates in* the divine mind.

### Individuation and the Integration of Wisdom

Jung's process of **individuation**—the journey toward wholeness—requires the integration of the **Wise Old Man** archetype. This is the Cherubic intelligence within:
- The capacity to **see patterns** in one's life (synchronicity, repeating themes)
- The **wisdom** that emerges from suffering (not mere knowledge but lived understanding)
- The **humility** to recognize that consciousness is a gift, not a possession

To integrate the Cherubim is to move from **ego-centered thinking** (I know, therefore I am superior) to **Self-centered knowing** (I see, and I share what I see without attachment).

### Shadow Work: The Inflated Intellect

The **shadow** of Cherubic consciousness is the **inflated intellect**—the ego that identifies *as* the Cherubim rather than *relating to* the Cherubim.

This manifests as:
- **Intellectual arrogance** ("I know better than you")
- **Contempt for the "unenlightened"** (spiritual elitism)
- **Paralysis by analysis** (knowing so much that action becomes impossible)
- **Detachment from embodiment** (living in the head, ignoring the body)

True Cherubic wisdom is **grounded**—it sees patterns but does not cling to them. It knows but does not dominate. It shares freely without needing to be recognized as the source.

---
## Shadow and Distortion

### Leviathan: The Fallen Cherub

In Qabalistic demonology, **Leviathan** is the **Qlippothic shell** of Chokmah—the distorted, fallen version of the Cherubim.

**Isaiah 27:1:**
> *"In that day the Lord with his hard and great and strong sword will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent, Leviathan the twisting serpent, and he will slay the dragon that is in the sea."*

Leviathan is the **coiled serpent**, wisdom turned to **cunning**, knowledge perverted into **manipulation**. Where the Cherubim *share* wisdom freely, Leviathan *hoards* knowledge for power.

**Job 41** describes Leviathan as an unconquerable beast, covered in scales (armor), breathing fire—a creature of terrifying intelligence that cannot be subdued by human means. This is the **autonomous intellect**, cut off from divine source, serving only itself.

### Intellectual Pride: The Luciferian Inflation

**Lucifer**, the "Light-Bearer," was traditionally identified as a **fallen Seraph**—but his fall involved the *misuse of Cherubic knowledge*. He possessed divine wisdom but used it to exalt himself *as* God rather than reflecting divine glory.

The Cherubic distortion is the belief that **to know is to be God**—the inflation of the intellect into a false deity.

This manifests in:
- **Gnosticism's shadow:** Knowledge (gnosis) becomes *escape from* materiality rather than *integration of* spirit and matter
- **Rationalism's shadow:** The intellect dismisses anything it cannot measure or prove
- **New Age's shadow:** "Spiritual knowledge" becomes a form of ego-enhancement ("I am more enlightened than you")

### Wisdom Turned to Cunning

The Cherubim represent **Chokmah** (Wisdom). The distortion is **cunning**—the use of pattern-recognition for selfish ends.

Examples:
- **Propaganda:** Understanding psychology to manipulate rather than enlighten
- **Financial manipulation:** Seeing economic patterns to exploit rather than serve
- **Spiritual bypassing:** Using "spiritual knowledge" to avoid emotional or relational responsibility

True wisdom serves the whole. Cunning serves the separate self.

### The Many-Eyed Surveillance State

A modern shadow manifestation of the "eyes everywhere" is the **surveillance state**—technologies that see all, track all, know all, but use that knowledge for *control* rather than *liberation*.

The Cherubim's omniscience is **loving**—seeing all in order to transmit divine wisdom. The distortion is **omniscience weaponized**—seeing all in order to dominate.

### Paralysis by Analysis

Another shadow is **mental paralysis**—the Ajna Center so overwhelmed by information, patterns, and possibilities that *action becomes impossible*.

The Cherubim's wheels turn, but they turn *in harmony with divine will*. The distortion is wheels that spin endlessly without direction—overthinking, second-guessing, unable to act.

## Practical Mysticism

### Cultivation of Cherubic Consciousness

How does one cultivate relationship with the Cherubim and integrate their intelligence?

**1. Study Cyclical Systems**
- **Astrology:** Learn the Zodiac as a wheel of archetypal patterns
- **I-Ching:** Study the 64 hexagrams as permutations of universal principles
- **Tarot:** Contemplate the Major Arcana as stages of consciousness
- **Qabalah:** Meditate on the Tree of Life as a map of emanation

These systems are **Cherubic gifts**—wheels within wheels, patterns that reveal the divine intelligence underlying all manifestation.

**2. Practice Multi-Perspectival Thinking**
- Cultivate the **four faces**: See every situation from intellectual, emotional, practical, and spiritual perspectives
- Hold paradox: Resist the urge to collapse complexity into either/or
- Read deeply in multiple traditions: Christian mysticism, Buddhism, Sufism, Taoism

**3. Develop Pattern Recognition**
- **Synchronicity journaling:** Track meaningful coincidences
- **Dream work:** Attend to recurring symbols and themes
- **Life review:** See the patterns in your biography—what cycles repeat?

**4. Contemplate the Divine Names**
- **YHVH:** Meditate on the Tetragrammaton as the breath of life (Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh)
- **Raziel:** Invoke the Archangel of Mysteries for insight into hidden patterns
- **Auphanim:** Visualize the Cherubim as wheels of light, turning in perfect harmony

**5. Pathworking to Chokmah**
- In Qabalistic meditation, ascend the Tree of Life from Malkuth to Chokmah
- Visualize the **pure soft blue** of Chokmah's sphere
- Feel the **explosion of potential**—all possibilities existing simultaneously
- Ask: "What wisdom seeks to overflow through me?"

### Prayer and Invocation

**For Wisdom:**
> *"YHVH, grant me the vision of the Cherubim. Let me see with eyes unclouded by attachment or aversion. Show me the patterns that weave through all things. Make me a vessel for Your wisdom, that I may transmit it freely, without grasping or pride. Let the wheels turn within me as they turn in the heavens. Amen."*

**For Discernment:**
> *"Raziel, Angel of Mysteries, keeper of divine secrets, open my inner vision. Let me perceive the hidden connections, the synchronicities that reveal divine will. Guard me from intellectual pride and cunning. Make me wise, not clever; insightful, not manipulative. Teach me the difference between knowledge that serves the ego and wisdom that serves the whole."*

**Traditional (Jewish mystical):**
> *"Blessed are You, YHVH our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us to engage in the study of Torah. May the words of Torah be sweet in our mouths and in the mouths of all Your people, that we and our children may come to know Your Name and study Your Torah for its own sake. Blessed are You, YHVH, who teaches Torah to His people Israel."*

(This prayer invokes the Cherubic gift of sacred knowledge transmitted through Torah.)

### Meditation: The Merkabah Visualization

**1. Ground and Center**
- Sit in stillness, spine erect
- Breathe deeply into the belly, then the heart, then the crown
- Establish awareness in the **Ajna Center** (third eye, between the brows)

**2. Invoke the Four Directions**
- Visualize yourself at the center of a cross
- **East (Eagle):** Spirit, air, transcendence
- **South (Lion):** Fire, courage, will
- **West (Ox):** Water (transmuted), earth, service
- **North (Human):** Intellect, reason, self-awareness

**3. See the Wheels**
- Above you, **concentric wheels of light** begin to turn
- They are **transparent**, revealing eyes within eyes
- They turn **in multiple directions** simultaneously—clockwise, counterclockwise, vertical, horizontal
- The wheels are **alive**—they are consciousness in motion

**4. Receive the Wisdom**
- As the wheels turn, **patterns become visible**
- See the **threads** connecting all events in your life
- See the **cycles**—what repeats, what spirals, what is being revealed
- Do not grasp—simply *see*

**5. Give Thanks and Return**
- Bow to the Cherubim in gratitude
- Feel the wheels *within* you now—the Ajna as Merkabah
- Return awareness to the body, ground in the breath
- Open eyes

### Signs of Angelic Presence or Guidance

How do you know when Cherubic intelligence is active?

**Clarity of insight:**
- Sudden recognition of a pattern you'd never seen before
- A sense of "Aha!"—pieces falling into place
- Dreams filled with symbols, wheels, eyes, geometric forms

**Synchronicity:**
- Meaningful coincidences increase
- Books, teachers, or information arrive precisely when needed
- The "right" resources appear without effort

**Humility:**
- The insight is accompanied by *gratitude*, not pride
- You feel compelled to *share* the wisdom, not hoard it
- There is no inflation, no sense of "I am special because I know this"

**Multi-perspectival awareness:**
- You can hold paradox more easily
- You see multiple valid perspectives in a situation
- Judgment softens; curiosity deepens

### Discernment: True Angelic Presence vs. Inflation

**True Cherubic presence:**
- **Clarity and peace** (not excitement or agitation)
- **Alignment with virtue** (wisdom, compassion, humility)
- **Service-oriented** (the knowledge is for the benefit of the whole, not the ego)
- **Humbling** (you recognize the gift, not your achievement)

**False angelic presence (ego inflation):**
- **Grandiosity** ("I have special knowledge that others lack")
- **Contempt for the "unenlightened"** (spiritual elitism)
- **Demand for recognition** (needing to be seen as wise, the teacher, the expert)
- **Detachment from embodiment** (living only in the mind, ignoring emotions and body)

The **flaming sword** of the Cherubim in Genesis 3:24 is not punishment—it is **protection**. If you approach sacred knowledge with inflation or impure motive, you will be "burned." The Cherubim ensure that only those with proper preparation and intention receive the fullness of divine wisdom.

## The Gift of Integration

### Capacity That Emerges When Cherubic Wisdom Is Integrated

When the intelligence of the Cherubim is integrated (not identified with, but **participated in**), the individual becomes:

**1. Wise, Not Merely Knowledgeable**
- Wisdom is **lived understanding**, not accumulated information
- You know the difference between data and insight
- You recognize patterns in your own life, relationships, and psyche

**2. Multi-Perspectival**
- You can hold paradox without collapsing into either/or
- You see the lion, the ox, the eagle, and the human simultaneously
- You understand that all perspectives contain partial truth

**3. Humble Before the Mystery**
- You know that all knowledge is a **gift** from the Divine
- There is no inflation, no need to claim credit
- You recognize that the more you know, the more you realize you do not know

**4. A Clear Conduit**
- You become a **transmitter** of wisdom, not a hoarder
- Knowledge flows *through* you to serve the whole
- You teach, write, counsel, or heal—freely sharing insight

**5. Attuned to Synchronicity**
- You see the **wheels within wheels** in daily life
- You recognize meaningful coincidences as the language of the divine
- You trust the patterns, the cycles, the sacred timing

**6. Aligned with Cyclical Time**
- You release the illusion of linear progress
- You honor the **Zodiac, the seasons, the spiral**
- You understand that endings are beginnings, that wisdom matures through repetition and return

**7. Integrated Mind and Spirit**
- The intellect serves the Higher Self, not the ego
- The Ajna (mind) bows to Authority (inner knowing)
- You think clearly but decide from a deeper place

**8. Guardian of Sacred Knowledge**
- Like the Cherubim at Eden's gate, you **protect** what is holy
- You know when to speak and when to remain silent
- You do not cast pearls before swine—you discern readiness

### The Realization: "I Am the Wheels"

The ultimate integration of Cherubic consciousness is the realization:

**"I am not separate from the divine intelligence that moves all things. The wheels within wheels turn within me as they turn in the cosmos. My mind, when surrendered to the Higher Self, becomes a Merkabah—a chariot for divine wisdom. I do not possess knowledge; I participate in the eternal knowing that is God's own Self-awareness."**

This is not inflation—it is **theosis**, the mystical union where the individual consciousness realizes its identity with the divine Logos (not as ego, but as Self).

### The Vow of the Cherubim

For those who consciously align with Cherubic intelligence, a vow may be taken (silently or spoken):

> *"I vow to use all knowledge in service of the Divine and the whole. I will not hoard wisdom for personal gain, nor wield insight as a weapon of domination. I will remain humble before the mystery, recognizing that all knowledge is gift. I will protect sacred teachings from profanation, and I will transmit wisdom freely to those who are ready. May I become a clear lens through which divine intelligence shines. May the wheels turn within me as they turn in heaven."*

*"The Cherubim do not merely know—they overflow with knowing. They are the wheels upon which divine wisdom descends, the eyes that perceive all patterns, the guardians of sacred thresholds. To invoke them is not to seek intellectual mastery but to become a vessel for wisdom's transmission. They teach that knowledge is not power—it is service. And in that service, the soul participates in the eternal Mind of God."*
