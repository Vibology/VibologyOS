## Overview

**Malachim** (Hebrew: מלאכים, "Kings" or "Messengers") is the angelic order associated with **[[Tiphareth]]** (Beauty), the sixth Sephirah on the Tree of Life—the solar center, the seat of the Higher Self. The word *malakh* (מלאך) is the standard Hebrew term for "angel" or "messenger," making the Malachim the quintessential angelic order.

The Malachim embody the **solar principle of harmony and integration**. They serve the function of mediating between the higher and lower Sephiroth, transmitting the balanced light of Tiphareth throughout the Tree. As "Kings," they represent the sovereign authority of the Higher Self over the personality.

In the Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchy, this order corresponds to the **[[Virtues]]** (fifth order), the angels who bestow grace and perform miracles.
