## Overview

**Tarshishim** (Hebrew: תרשישים, "Brilliant Ones" or "Beryl Angels") is the angelic order sometimes associated with **[[Netzach]]** (Victory), the seventh Sephirah on the Tree of Life. The name derives from *tarshish*, a precious stone (possibly beryl, chrysolite, or topaz) mentioned in Ezekiel's vision of the divine chariot (Ezekiel 1:16, 10:9).

The Tarshishim embody the **Venusian qualities** of beauty, desire, and the life force that endures. They are angels of nature, passion, and creative inspiration—the forces that make existence desirable and beautiful.

In some Qabalistic systems, the Tarshishim are associated with different Sephiroth. Davidson notes varying attributions in the tradition (Davidson, p. 283).
