## Overview

**Ishim** (Hebrew: אישים, "Flames" or "Men of Fire") is the angelic order associated with **[[Malkuth]]** (Kingdom), the tenth Sephirah on the Tree of Life. Often used interchangeably with **[[Ashim]]**, this order represents the angels closest to humanity—those who have achieved angelic status or who serve as guardians of the material realm.

The name *Ishim* derives from *ish* (אש, "fire" or "man"), suggesting beings of fire who take human-like form. In Jewish mystical tradition, the Ishim are sometimes identified with the prophets and righteous souls who have been elevated to angelic status after death.

Davidson notes that the Ishim are "composed of fire and snow" and serve as the angels most accessible to human perception and invocation (Davidson, p. 156).
