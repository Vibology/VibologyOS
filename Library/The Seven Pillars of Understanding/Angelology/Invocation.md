# Invocation
*The Art of Calling Upon Angelic Presence*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

**Invocation** is the ritual practice of calling upon angelic beings—requesting their presence, guidance, protection, or assistance. Unlike evocation (which summons entities into external manifestation), invocation is an **interior act**: opening the self to receive angelic influence, aligning consciousness with higher frequencies.

Invocation is the **Anima** dimension of Angelology—the lived practice that transforms intellectual knowledge of the angelic hierarchies into direct experiential relationship. One can study the [[The Nine Angelic Orders|Nine Orders]] and [[The Archangels|Archangels]] as taxonomy; invocation makes them allies.

## Principles

### 1. Alignment, Not Command
Invocation is petition, not compulsion. One does not command angels but aligns with their nature, making oneself a fit vessel for their influence.

### 2. Correspondence
Each angelic being corresponds to specific:
- **Sephiroth** (Tree of Life position)
- **Planets** (astrological timing)
- **Days/Hours** (temporal windows)
- **Colors, incenses, names** (sympathetic resonance)

Effective invocation employs appropriate correspondences to strengthen the connection.

### 3. Purity of Intention
Angels respond to the quality of the request. Self-serving manipulation fails; sincere aspiration toward the Good succeeds.

### 4. Divine Permission
Traditional invocation operates within a framework of divine authority—calling upon angels "in the name of" the Divine, not as independent powers.

## Basic Structure

### 1. Preparation
- Purify space and self (bathing, fasting, cleansing)
- Gather appropriate correspondences (candles, incense, symbols)
- Enter receptive mental state

### 2. Opening
- Acknowledge the Divine source
- State intention clearly
- Create sacred container (circle, prayer, psalm)

### 3. Invocation Proper
- Speak the angel's name(s) with reverence
- Recite traditional prayers or compose sincere petition
- Visualize the angelic presence (traditional imagery or intuitive impression)

### 4. Communion
- Maintain receptive silence
- Note impressions, sensations, insights
- Allow the presence to communicate

### 5. Closing
- Express gratitude
- Formally release the invocation
- Ground and return to ordinary consciousness

## Cautions

- **Discernment:** Not every spiritual impression is angelic. Test spirits against tradition and conscience.
- **Balance:** Invocation supplements but does not replace practical action and psychological work.
- **Humility:** Avoid inflation from spiritual experiences. The goal is service, not spiritual status.
