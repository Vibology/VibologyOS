## Overview

**Angels of Judgment** refers to angelic beings tasked with executing divine justice, weighing souls, and enforcing cosmic law. This category spans multiple orders and specific angels:

### Primary Associations

2. **[[Kamael]]** — Archangel of [[Geburah]] (Severity), executor of divine discipline

3. **[[Samael]]** — The angel of death and adversary, who tests and accuses

4. **[[Powers]]** — The angelic order that enforces cosmic boundaries and resists demonic incursion

### Function in Divine Economy

Angels of Judgment serve to:
- **Weigh souls** — Determining alignment with divine order (Michael's scales)
- **Execute severity** — Cutting away what is corrupt or harmful (Geburah function)
- **Enforce boundaries** — Maintaining cosmic law against transgression
- **Test and refine** — The adversarial function that strengthens through challenge
