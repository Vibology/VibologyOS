# Heptarchia Mystica
*The Seven-Fold Planetary Hierarchy — The 49 Good Angels and the Sigillum Dei Aemeth*

---
## Introduction

The **Heptarchia Mystica** ("Mystical Sevenfold Rule") is the earliest component of the [[Enochian System Overview|Enochian system]], revealed to [[John Dee and Edward Kelley]] in **1582**, before the reception of [[The Four Watchtowers]] or [[The 30 Aethyrs]]. It constitutes a complete system of **planetary magic**, centered on:

1. **The Sigillum Dei Aemeth** — The Seal of God's Truth, a complex wax talisman inscribed with divine names
2. **49 Good Angels** — Seven sets of seven angels, each governing a day of the week and a classical planet
3. **The Holy Table** — A consecrated wooden table supporting the magical apparatus
4. **Planetary invocations** — Methods for petitioning the angels for knowledge, power, and divine favor

Unlike the later Watchtowers (which organize angels by element) or the Aethyrs (which map consciousness), the Heptarchia organizes angelic forces by **planetary attribution**—Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn—linking Enochian magic to astrological timing and Qabalistic correspondences.

**Primary Sources:**
- Dee's diaries (*Mysteriorum Libri Quinque* and related manuscripts)
- The angelic revealing entities: **Nalvage**, **Ave**, **Uriel**, and others

---
## The Sigillum Dei Aemeth

### Structure

The **Sigillum Dei Aemeth** (Seal of God's Truth) is a large wax disc, approximately 9 inches in diameter, inscribed with:

- **A central heptagon** (seven-sided figure)
- **Seven divine names** within the heptagon
- **Outer pentagram** enclosing the heptagon
- **40 concentric circles** containing additional names and letters
- **Seven subsidiary seals** (smaller discs) placed under the legs of the Holy Table and under the scrying equipment

**Materials:**
- **Pure beeswax** — Traditionally white or unbleached
- **Inscribed carefully** — The names and symbols must be exact; errors invalidate the seal

**Function:**
- **Establishes sacred authority** — The seal declares the operator's alignment with divine will
- **Protects the working** — Acts as a spiritual barrier against deception or malevolent forces
- **Activates planetary angels** — The seal is the "key" that unlocks access to the 49 Good Angels

### The Central Heptagon

**Seven Divine Names:**

Within the central heptagon are seven mystical names of God, revealed by the angels:

1. **Sabathiel** (or variations in manuscript)
2. **Zedekieil**
3. **Madimiel**
4. **Semeliel**
5. **Nogahel**
6. **Corabiel**
7. **Levanael**

**Attribution:** Each name governs a planetary force (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, respectively).

### The Outer Rings

**40 Names in concentric circles:**
- Letters and syllables forming divine and angelic names
- Read in specific patterns (spiraling, radial, circular)

**Pentagram:**
- Five-pointed star enclosing the heptagon
- Represents the five elements (Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Spirit) or the five senses brought under divine control

### The Seven Subsidiary Seals

**Smaller seals** (approximately 1.5 inches in diameter) placed:
- **Four seals** under the four legs of the Holy Table
- **Three seals** under the scrying equipment (crystal, shewstone, etc.)

**Function:** Ground and anchor the Sigillum's power into the physical apparatus.

---
## The 49 Good Angels

### Organization

The 49 angels are arranged in **seven groups of seven**, each group governed by a **King** and **Prince** (or "Duke" in some sources):

| Day | Planet | King | Prince | Number of Ministers |
|-----|--------|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Sunday** | Sol (Sun) | **Carmara** | **Hagonel** | 42 Ministers |
| **Monday** | Luna (Moon) | **Hagonel** | **Ilemese** | 42 Ministers |
| **Tuesday** | Mars | **Baligon** | **Bornogo** | 42 Ministers |
| **Wednesday** | Mercury | **Babalel** | **Brorges** | 42 Ministers |
| **Thursday** | Jupiter | **Bornogo** | **Befafes** | 42 Ministers |
| **Friday** | Venus | **Bnapsen** | **Blisdon** | 42 Ministers |
| **Saturday** | Saturn | **Bnaspol** | **Blemsin** | 42 Ministers |

**Total:** 7 Kings + 7 Princes + (7 × 5 = 35) Ministers = **49 angels**

**Note:** Some manuscript variations list different names or numbers. The above follows Dee's core diaries.

### The Seven Kings

**Function:** Supreme rulers of their planetary day, wielding authority over all angelic forces associated with that planet.

**Invocation:** Kings are invoked for **major petitions**—knowledge, power, transformation, divine favor.

**Planetary Correspondences:**

1. **Carmara** (Sun/Sunday) — Solar force, vitality, authority, illumination
2. **Hagonel** (Moon/Monday) — Lunar force, intuition, dreams, the subconscious
3. **Baligon** (Mars/Tuesday) — Martial force, courage, conflict, decisive action
4. **Babalel** (Mercury/Wednesday) — Mercurial force, communication, intellect, adaptability
5. **Bornogo** (Jupiter/Thursday) — Jupiterian force, expansion, prosperity, wisdom
6. **Bnapsen** (Venus/Friday) — Venusian force, love, beauty, harmony
7. **Bnaspol** (Saturn/Saturday) — Saturnian force, limitation, structure, discipline

### The Seven Princes

**Function:** Lieutenants of the Kings, governing specific functions within the planetary sphere.

**Invocation:** Princes are invoked for **specific tasks** within the planetary domain (e.g., Hagonel for lunar visions, Brorges for mercurial speed).

### The 35 Ministers

**Function:** Lesser angels who serve the Kings and Princes, executing specific operations.

**Names:** Derived from the Sigillum Dei Aemeth through complex letter extraction methods.

**Invocation:** Ministers are called for **practical, specific tasks** (e.g., success in travel, healing an illness, gaining information).

---
## The Holy Table and Apparatus

### The Holy Table

**Dimensions:** Approximately 3 feet square (some sources vary)

**Materials:** Wood (often oak or cedar), painted or inscribed with divine names

**Inscription:** The table's top is divided into sections containing:
- **The Sigillum Dei Aemeth** (placed at the center)
- **Divine names** around the perimeter
- **Geometric patterns** (sometimes hexagrams or crosses)

**Function:** Provides a consecrated surface for the scrying equipment, establishing a "temple" for angelic communication.

### The Table of Practice

**Dimensions:** Smaller than the Holy Table (approximately 1.5 feet square)

**Function:** The operator stands or sits at this table during invocations, placing ritual tools (wand, ring, lamen) upon it.

**Inscription:** Contains the names of the angels being invoked, protective seals, and divine names.

### The Scrying Equipment

**Crystal or Shewstone:**
- **Polished obsidian mirror** (Dee's "black stone")
- **Crystal ball** (clear quartz or other gemstone)
- **Function:** The scryer (Kelley) gazes into the crystal to see and hear the angels

**Placement:** The crystal rests upon the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, with three subsidiary seals beneath it.

### The Ring and Lamen

**The Ring:** A gold ring inscribed with "PELE" (a divine name) and worn by the operator to signify authority.

**The Lamen:** A hexagonal pendant worn over the heart, inscribed with divine names and the Sigillum pattern, identifying the operator as a legitimate invoker.

## Planetary Timing and Invocation

### Astrological Correspondences

**Planetary Days:**
- **Sunday** — Sun (Carmara)
- **Monday** — Moon (Hagonel)
- **Tuesday** — Mars (Baligon)
- **Wednesday** — Mercury (Babalel)
- **Thursday** — Jupiter (Bornogo)
- **Friday** — Venus (Bnapsen)
- **Saturday** — Saturn (Bnaspol)

**Planetary Hours:**
Each day is divided into 12 daylight hours and 12 nighttime hours, each ruled by a planet in sequence. Optimal invocation occurs during the **planetary hour of the desired planet on its corresponding day**.

**Example:** To invoke Bornogo (Jupiter) for prosperity, work on **Thursday** during a **Jupiter hour** (1st hour after sunrise, 8th hour after sunrise, etc.).

### Invocation Method

**Standard Sequence:**

1. **Consecration of Space:**
   - Perform banishing ritual (if desired, though Dee did not use the LBRP)
   - Light candles, burn incense (frankincense, myrrh, or planetary-specific incense)

2. **Activation of the Sigillum:**
   - Gaze upon the Sigillum, meditating on its structure
   - Speak the seven divine names of the central heptagon

3. **Invocation of the King:**
   - Face the appropriate direction (East for Sunday/Sun, West for Monday/Moon, etc., per traditional planetary attributions)
   - Speak: *"I call upon thee, [KING NAME], great King of [PLANET/DAY], who governs the forces of [PLANETARY QUALITY]. Hear my petition and grant thy wisdom."*

4. **State the Petition:**
   - Be specific, clear, and respectful
   - Example: *"Grant me knowledge of the hidden forces governing [topic]. Reveal to me the path to [goal]."*

5. **Scrying or Reception:**
   - The scryer gazes into the crystal, reporting visions or voices
   - The operator records the communication

6. **Gratitude and Dismissal:**
   - Thank the King and attendant angels
   - Speak: *"I give thanks, [KING NAME]. Return to thy station in peace. So be it."*

## Cross-System Correspondences

### Qabalistic Tree of Life

The seven planets correspond to seven Sephiroth:

| Planet | Heptarchia King | Sephirah | Qabalistic Archangel |
|--------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| Saturn | Bnaspol | [[Binah]] | [[Tzaphkiel]] |
| Jupiter | Bornogo | [[Chesed]] | [[Tzadkiel]] |
| Mars | Baligon | [[Geburah]] | [[Kamael]] |
| Sol | Carmara | [[Tiphareth]] | [[Michael]] or [[Raphael]] |
| Venus | Bnapsen | [[Netzach]] | [[Haniel]] |
| Mercury | Babalel | [[Hod]] | [[Raphael]] or [[Michael]] |
| Luna | Hagonel | [[Yesod]] | [[Gabriel]] |

**Integration:** Practitioners often invoke both the Enochian Kings and the Qabalistic Archangels in a single ritual, layering systems for greater potency.

### Tarot

The seven planets govern specific Major Arcana:

- **Sun (Carmara)** → [[The Sun]] (XIX)
- **Moon (Hagonel)** → [[The Moon]] (XVIII), [[The High Priestess]] (II)
- **Mars (Baligon)** → [[The Tower]] (XVI)
- **Mercury (Babalel)** → [[The Magician]] (I)
- **Jupiter (Bornogo)** → [[The Wheel of Fortune]] (X)
- **Venus (Bnapsen)** → [[The Empress]] (III)
- **Saturn (Bnaspol)** → [[The World]] (XXI), [[The Devil]] (XV)

### Astrology

The Heptarchia directly invokes planetary forces:
- **Bornogo (Jupiter)** — Expansion, growth, prosperity (Jupiter in natal chart)
- **Baligon (Mars)** — Action, aggression, courage (Mars transits)
- **Bnapsen (Venus)** — Love, beauty, relationship (Venus return)

**Practical Application:** Invoke the appropriate King during planetary transits, returns, or when natal planets are activated.

## The Shadow of the Heptarchia

### Ego Inflation

**Danger:** Receiving favors from the angels and attributing success to personal power rather than divine grace

**Shadow Manifestation:** Arrogance, hubris, belief that one "controls" the angels

**Remedy:** Humility. The angels serve God, not the operator. The magician is a petitioner, not a master.

### Planetary Imbalance

**Danger:** Overinvoking a single planet (e.g., Mars for power, Venus for pleasure) without balancing with other forces

**Shadow Manifestation:**
- Too much Mars: Aggression, conflict, burnout
- Too much Venus: Hedonism, lack of discipline
- Too much Saturn: Depression, rigidity, isolation

**Remedy:** Invoke all seven planets over time, honoring the full spectrum of cosmic forces.

### Neglect of the Sigillum

**Danger:** Attempting Heptarchia invocations without properly constructing and consecrating the Sigillum Dei Aemeth

**Shadow Manifestation:** Weak results, attraction of deceptive entities, spiritual confusion

**Remedy:** The Sigillum is **non-optional**. Without it, the operator has no legitimate authority in the Heptarchic system.

## Relationship to Later Enochian Systems

### Chronology

1. **Heptarchia Mystica** (1582) — Planetary magic, the Sigillum
2. **Liber Loagaeth** (1583) — The 49 mystical tables
3. **The Great Table (Watchtowers)** (1584) — Elemental magic
4. **The 30 Aethyrs** (1584-1585) — Visionary ascent

### Integration

**The Heptarchia is foundational:**
- The Sigillum is used in **all** Enochian operations (Watchtowers, Aethyrs, etc.)
- Planetary timing enhances later work (e.g., invoking the Fire Watchtower on Tuesday during a Mars hour)
- The 49 Good Angels can be invoked alongside Watchtower Kings or Aethyr Governors for layered operations

**Example Hybrid Ritual:**
1. Invoke Bornogo (Jupiter) for expansion
2. Then invoke the King of the Air Watchtower (Bataivah) for intellectual clarity
3. Combine Jupiterian abundance with Airy communication for success in teaching or publishing

## Historical Context: Dee's Early Angelic Contacts

### The First Revelations (1581-1582)

**Uriel** appeared to Dee and Kelley in 1581, instructing them to construct the Holy Table and Sigillum. The Heptarchia followed, delivered by **Nalvage**, **Ave**, and other angelic intermediaries.

**Nalvage's Teachings:**
- Stern, authoritative, uncompromising
- Emphasized the **necessity of precision**—every name, every line of the Sigillum must be exact
- Warned against casual or frivolous invocation

**Ave's Role:**
- Gentler than Nalvage, more explanatory
- Provided the names of the 49 angels
- Clarified the structure of the Heptarchia

### Dee's Intentions

Dee sought:
- **Scientific knowledge** — Secrets of nature, the cosmos, mathematics
- **Political guidance** — Counsel for Queen Elizabeth I and England's role in divine providence
- **Spiritual communion** — Direct access to angelic wisdom

The Heptarchia provided a **practical framework** for these goals, allowing Dee to petition specific planetary angels for specific purposes.

---
## The Gift of the Heptarchia

At its highest expression, the Heptarchia Mystica offers:

**Planetary attunement** — Aligning personal will with cosmic cycles
**Practical magic** — Tangible results through angelic petition
**Sacred technology** — The Sigillum as a key to the celestial realms
**Balanced cosmology** — Honoring all seven planetary forces, not fixating on one
**Foundation for advanced work** — Mastery of the Heptarchia prepares the operator for the Watchtowers and Aethyrs

The Heptarchia is the **training ground** of Enochian magic. Those who learn to invoke the 49 Good Angels with humility, precision, and clear intention build the skills necessary for the more dangerous and exalted operations to come.

### Vibology Synthesis

**All cross-system correspondences and interpretive frameworks represent Vibology synthesis, not original Dee/Kelley doctrine:**

- **Qabalistic Tree of Life correspondences** (Saturn/Binah/Tzaphkiel, Jupiter/Chesed/Tzadkiel, etc.) — Post-Golden Dawn integration, not present in Dee's original work
- **Tarot Major Arcana correspondences** (Sun/XIX, Moon/XVIII, Tower/XVI, etc.) — Modern esoteric attribution
- **Astrological applications** (natal chart work, transits, planetary returns) — Contemporary synthesis
- **Ethical considerations** (e.g., "never petition for control over another's will" in love magic) — Modern magical ethics, not explicitly addressed by Dee
- **Shadow work framework** (ego inflation, planetary imbalance) — Jungian psychological overlay
- **Hybrid ritual examples** (combining Heptarchic Kings with Watchtower Kings) — Advanced modern practice

**Planetary exclusions note:** The doctrine that each element excludes one planet (Air/Jupiter, Water/Mercury, Fire/Moon, Earth/Venus) derives from later Watchtower system integration. The Heptarchia itself includes all seven classical planets.

**Historical accuracy:** Dee approached the Heptarchia with devotion and scientific rigor. His motivations were theological (restore Adamic language), philosophical (access hidden knowledge), and political (guidance for England's role in divine providence). The system predates the more famous Watchtowers and Aethyrs by 2-3 years.

*"The Heptarchia Mystica is the threshold of Enochian magic—the first test of the aspirant's humility and precision. To construct the Sigillum is to declare: 'I am willing to labor for truth.' To invoke the Kings is to petition: 'Grant me thy wisdom, for I am a servant of the Highest.' Those who approach with reverence will find that the 49 Good Angels are not distant abstractions but living presences, ready to guide, teach, and empower—if the operator proves worthy."*
