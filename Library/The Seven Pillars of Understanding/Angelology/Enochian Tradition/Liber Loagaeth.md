# Liber Loagaeth
*The Book of the Speech from God*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

## Overview

**Liber Loagaeth** (Latin/Enochian: "Book of the Speech from God") is the most mysterious component of the Enochian system revealed to [[John Dee and Edward Kelley]]. It consists of **49 tables**, each containing a 49×49 grid of letters in the Enochian alphabet—a total of 120,050 characters whose purpose remains largely unknown.

Unlike the [[Heptarchia Mystica]], [[The Four Watchtowers]], or [[The 30 Aethyrs]], Dee and Kelley received no explicit instructions for using Liber Loagaeth. The angels simply delivered the tables without explanation, leaving practitioners to speculate about their function.

## Structure

- **49 Tables** — Corresponding to the 7×7 structure pervasive in Enochian magic
- **49×49 Grids** — Each table contains 2,401 letter-cells
- **120,050 Total Characters** — In the Enochian alphabet
- **Revealed 1583-1584** — During the intensive scrying sessions at Krakow and Prague

## Theories of Purpose

### Meditative Focus
Gazing at the grids may induce altered states of consciousness, functioning as visual mantras or scrying surfaces.

### Angelic Language Primer
The tables may encode deeper grammatical, phonetic, or mystical structures of the [[Enochian Language and the 48 Keys|Enochian language]]—a kind of cosmic dictionary or grammar.

### Cosmic Cartography
Each table might correspond to planetary, zodiacal, or Aethyric forces—a complete map of creation in letter-form.

### Sealed Knowledge
The content may be deliberately incomprehensible to human consciousness in its current state—knowledge reserved for future revelation or post-mortem understanding.

## Modern Practice

Few practitioners work directly with Liber Loagaeth due to its obscurity. Those who do typically use it as:
- A scrying tool (gazing at specific tables)
- A meditative object (contemplating the grids)
- A source of derived names or sigils (extracting letter-sequences)
