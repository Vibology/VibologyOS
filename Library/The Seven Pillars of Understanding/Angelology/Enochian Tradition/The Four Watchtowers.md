# The Four Watchtowers
*The Great Table of Earth — Elemental Tablets of Divine and Angelic Names*

---
## Essence
The **Four Watchtowers** (also called the **Great Table** or **Tablets of the Earth**) constitute the architectural core of [[Enochian Tradition|Enochian magic]]. Revealed to [[John Dee and Edward Kelley]] between 1583-1584, these four elemental tablets form a unified grid containing:

- **Divine names** (Names of God governing each element)
- **Angelic hierarchies** (Kings, Seniors, and lesser angels)
- **Magical squares** (Sub-angles, Kerubic, Servient, and Calvary Cross positions)
- **Directional attributions** (East/Air, South/Fire, West/Water, North/Earth)

Each Watchtower is a **12x13 grid of letters** from which practitioners derive names of power for elemental invocation, manifestation work, and cosmological exploration. Together with the **Tablet of Union** (which unifies all four), they create the most sophisticated system of elemental magic in the Western esoteric tradition.

---
## Structure of the Great Table

### Overall Configuration

The Great Table consists of:

**Four Elemental Tablets** — Each 12 columns × 13 rows = 156 squares per tablet
**Tablet of Union** — A central cross of 5 rows × 4 columns = 20 squares
**Total Letters** — (156 × 4) + 20 = 644 letters

### The Tablet of Union

**Position:** Occupies the center where the four elemental tablets meet (forming a cross)

**Function:** Contains the **unifying divine names** that must be invoked before working with any individual Watchtower

**Structure:**
```
E X A R P
H C O M A
N A N T A
B I T O M
```

**Divine Names (read vertically):**
- **EXARP** — Air (East)
- **HCOMA** — Water (West)
- **NANTA** — Earth (North)
- **BITOM** — Fire (South)

**Invocation:** These names are vibrated before any Watchtower work to establish unity and balance across the four elements.[^1]

### Directional and Elemental Attributions

| Direction | Element | Archangel | Color (Golden Dawn) | Tattwa Symbol |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| **East** | Air | [[Raphael]] | Yellow | Blue Circle (Vayu) |
| **South** | Fire | [[Michael]] | Red | Red Triangle (Tejas) |
| **West** | Water | [[Gabriel]] | Blue | Silver Crescent (Apas) |
| **North** | Earth | [[Uriel]] | Green/Black | Yellow Square (Prithvi) |

## The Structure of Each Watchtower

Every Watchtower tablet (12×13 grid) contains the following components:

### 1. The Calvary Cross (Linea Spiritus Sancti)

**Position:** The central vertical column (6th column) and horizontal row (6th row), forming a cross

**Function:** Contains the **divine names** ruling the entire Watchtower

**Names Derived:**
- **Vertical name** (13 letters) — Read from top to bottom
- **Horizontal name** (12 letters) — Read from left to right
- **Sub-names** — Various combinations of letters from the cross

**Example (Air Tablet):**
- Vertical: **ORO IBAH AOZPI** (13 letters)
- Horizontal: **RZIONR NRZFM** (12 letters)

### 2. The Four Sub-Angles (Lesser Angles)

**Position:** The four quadrants created by dividing each Watchtower at the Calvary Cross

**Structure:** Each sub-angle is a 5×6 grid (30 squares)

**Function:** Each sub-angle governs:
- **10° of a zodiacal sign**
- **A sub-element** (e.g., Fire of Air, Water of Fire)
- **A Tarot Court Card** (King, Queen, Prince, Princess)

**Total Sub-Angles:** 4 tablets × 4 sub-angles = 16 sub-angles (corresponding to the 16 Court Cards of the Tarot)

### 3. The Kerubic Squares (Four Corners)

**Position:** The four corner squares of each sub-angle

**Function:** Govern the **Kerubic forces** (the four living creatures of Ezekiel's vision: Lion, Eagle, Bull, Human)

**Attribution:**
- **Top-left** — Air element of the sub-angle
- **Top-right** — Water element of the sub-angle
- **Bottom-left** — Fire element of the sub-angle
- **Bottom-right** — Earth element of the sub-angle

### 4. The Servient Squares

**Position:** The remaining 26 letters in each sub-angle (after removing the 4 Kerubic corners)

**Function:** Provide names of **lesser angelic and demonic entities** who serve the higher forces

**Derivation:** Names are extracted by various methods (diagonals, spirals, specific patterns)

### 5. The Six Seniors

**Position:** Immediately surrounding the Calvary Cross in each Watchtower

**Function:** Six planetary angels governing the Watchtower, one for each classical planet (excluding one planet per element)

**Planetary Exclusions:**
- **Air** excludes Jupiter
- **Water** excludes Mercury
- **Fire** excludes Luna (Moon)
- **Earth** excludes Venus

**Derivation:** Seven-letter names read from specific positions around the Calvary Cross

### 6. The King

**Position:** The central square where the vertical and horizontal arms of the Calvary Cross intersect

**Function:** The supreme ruling angel of the entire Watchtower

**Name Length:** Eight letters (derived from surrounding squares)

## Deriving Angelic Names

### Method for Extracting Names

The names of angels are derived from the Watchtowers using specific methods:

**1. The Six Seniors (7-letter names):**
- Read from the squares immediately adjacent to the Calvary Cross
- Each Senior governs a planetary force within the element

**2. The King (8-letter name):**
- Derived from the central square and surrounding positions
- Some traditions use the central letter plus spiraling outward

**3. Kerubic Angels (varies):**
- The four corner letters of each sub-angle
- Sometimes combined with adjacent letters for fuller names

**4. Servient Angels (3-7 letters):**
- Extracted from diagonals, rows, columns within sub-angles
- Golden Dawn methods use complex geometric patterns

### Example: Deriving a Senior Name (Air Tablet, Mars)

**HABIORO** (Mars in Air):
- Read horizontally from the right side of the Calvary Cross, top row
- H-A-B-I-O-R-O

**Invocation:**
- "HABIORO, Senior of Mars in the Watchtower of Air, come forth..."

---
## Invocation
### Opening the Watchtowers (Full Ritual)

**1. Preparation:**
- Banishing ritual (LBRP or similar)

- Set clear intention for the working

**2. Invoke the Tablet of Union:**
Vibrate the unifying names:
> *"EXARP, HCOMA, NANTA, BITOM — Let the four elements be in balance and harmony."*

**Example (Air Watchtower):**
> *"In the East, I call upon BATAIVAH, great King of Air!*
> *I invoke the Six Seniors: HABIORO, AAOZAIF, HTMORDA, AHAOZPI, AVTOTAR, HIPOTGA.*
> *Let the winds of wisdom blow, let thought be clarified, let communication flow.*
> *I stand at the threshold of the Eastern Watchtower. Open the gates!"*

**4. Specific Work:**
- Petition for knowledge, power, or vision
- Scrying into the elemental realms
- Invoking specific angels for particular purposes

**5. Closing:**
- Thank the Kings and Seniors

- Banishing ritual (LBRP)

### Elemental Invocations for Specific Purposes

**Air Watchtower:**
- **Communication magic** — Clarity in speech, writing, persuasion
- **Intellectual pursuits** — Study, analysis, problem-solving
- **Travel** — Safe journeys, swift passage

**Water Watchtower:**
- **Emotional healing** — Releasing grief, opening the heart
- **Divination** — Scrying, dream work, intuitive knowing
- **Relationship magic** — Love, connection, empathy

- Tarot: **King of Swords** (Fire of Air)
- Invocation for: Balanced judgment, fair communication, legal matters

**Water of Water (Southwest):**
- Zodiac: First 10° of Scorpio (Fixed Water)
- Tarot: **Queen of Cups** (Water of Water)

## Fallen Aspect

### Dangers of Elemental Imbalance

**Overinvoking Air:**
- Mental overstimulation, anxiety, disconnection from body
- "Paralysis by analysis," intellectual arrogance

**Overinvoking Water:**
- Emotional overwhelm, boundary dissolution, psychic flooding
- Depression, escapism, victim consciousness

**Overinvoking Fire:**
- Burnout, aggression, recklessness
- Ego inflation, domination, destructive rage

**Overinvoking Earth:**
- Stagnation, rigidity, materialism
- Fear-based control, hoarding, inertia

**Solution:** Always invoke the **Tablet of Union** first to maintain balance. Close with banishing to release excess elemental force.

### Servient Entities (Demonic Forces)

Not all entities in the Watchtowers are benevolent. The **Servient Squares** contain names of **demonic** or **chaotic** forces who serve the higher angels but can cause harm if invoked improperly.

**Precautions:**
- Never invoke Servient names without full knowledge of their function
- Always work under the authority of the King and Seniors
- Use protective circles, pentagrams, and divine names

---
## Cross-System Correspondences

### Tarot

**The 16 Court Cards** map directly to the 16 sub-angles:

| Court Card | Element of Element | Sub-Angle Position |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| King of Wands | Fire of Fire | Southwest of Fire Tablet |
| Queen of Cups | Water of Water | Southwest of Water Tablet |
| Prince of Swords | Air of Air | Northeast of Air Tablet |
| Princess of Pentacles | Earth of Earth | Northwest of Earth Tablet |

### Astrology

Each sub-angle governs **10° of a zodiacal sign**, creating a direct link between Enochian magic and astrological timing:

**Example Timing:**
- Working with the Air of Air sub-angle during the first 10° of Libra season enhances intellectual clarity
- Invoking the Water of Water sub-angle during the first 10° of Scorpio deepens emotional transformation

### Qabalistic Tree of Life

**The Four Watchtowers** correspond to the **four Qabalistic Worlds**:

- **Air (East)** → **Atziluth** (archetypal, pure idea)
- **Water (West)** → **Briah** (creative, emotional formation)
- **Fire (South)** → **Yetzirah** (formative, willful action)
- **Earth (North)** → **Assiah** (material, physical manifestation)

**The Tablet of Union** corresponds to **Kether** (the unifying crown) or the **Middle Pillar** (balance).

### Human Design

**Watchtower-Center Correspondences:**

- **Air Watchtower** → **Throat Center** (communication, manifestation)
- **Water Watchtower** → **Solar Plexus** (emotional wave, feeling)
- **Fire Watchtower** → **Sacral/Heart** (life force, will, ego)
- **Earth Watchtower** → **Root** (pressure, survival, grounding)

## The Gift of Integration

At their highest expression, the Four Watchtowers offer:

**Cosmological literacy** — Understanding the architecture of creation
**Elemental mastery** — Balancing and directing the four forces within and without
**Angelic communion** — Direct contact with planetary and elemental intelligences
**Practical magic** — A functional system for manifestation, healing, and transformation
**Initiatory structure** — The sub-angles provide 16 stages of elemental initiation

The Watchtowers are not abstract philosophy—they are a **functional tool** for engaging the living intelligences that govern the elements. Those who approach them with discipline, respect, and clear intention will find them to be among the most powerful magical structures ever revealed.
