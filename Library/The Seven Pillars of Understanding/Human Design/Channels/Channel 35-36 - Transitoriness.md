# Channel 35-36
*Transitoriness*

---
## Ra's Definition
According to Ra Uru Hu, the **Channel of Transitoriness** is the **emotional experience channel**—the drive to experience **everything** through the lens of the emotional wave, learning through **crisis, change, and transition**. This channel connects the **Solar Plexus** (emotional awareness) to the **Throat** (manifestation), creating the **voice of feeling and experience**.

Ra taught that this channel embodies the **need for change and new experience**—not from boredom, but from the understanding that **wisdom comes through experience, not theory**. This is the "jack of all trades"—the one who tastes everything, learns through crisis, and shares the emotional lessons through voice.

**"The 35-36 is the experiential being. They don't learn from books—they learn from living. They must experience it, feel it, go through the crisis, and then they can speak about it. This is 'I feel'—the voice of the emotional wave in action."** — Ra Uru Hu

The keynote is **transitoriness**—the understanding that all experience is temporary, that change is the only constant, and that emotional crisis is the catalyst for growth.

## I-Ching and Abstract Circuit Analysis

**Hexagram 35 (Progress):** Fire above, Earth below—light emerging from darkness. The need for **change, progress, and new experience**. Growth requires leaving the familiar.

**Hexagram 36 (Darkening of the Light):** Earth above, Fire below—light hidden beneath darkness. The understanding that **crisis and difficulty are temporary**—the dark times give way to light, teaching resilience.

**Abstract Circuit Role:** In the Abstract (Sensing) Circuit, 35-36 **expresses the emotional experience** that has been initiated by desire (30-41), sustained through commitment (29-46), and will eventually be reflected upon (47-64) and matured (42-53).

**The Crisis Teacher:** This channel learns through **emotional crisis**—not pathologically, but as the natural cycle of the wave. The darkness (36) gives way to progress (35), and the individual **shares the wisdom gained** from navigating the transitions.

## Channel Formation and Dynamics

**Gate 36 (Solar Plexus):** "I experience emotional crisis and turbulence as part of the wave."
**Gate 35 (Throat):** "I voice my need for change and share what I've learned through experience."
**Channel 35-36:** "I learn through diverse, crisis-filled experiences and speak the emotional truth of what I've lived."

**Manifested (Emotional) Nature:** This is a **Manifestor channel**, but because it connects to the Solar Plexus, it must **wait through the emotional wave** before initiating or speaking. Manifesting while in emotional highs or lows leads to regret.

---
## Strategy, Authority, and Deconditioning

**For Emotional Manifestors with 35-36:** **Inform before initiating change**, and **wait through the wave** before speaking or acting on emotional experiences. The crisis is real, but the emotional clarity comes only after the wave.

**Shadow Patterns:**
- **Restlessness:** Constantly seeking new experiences to avoid stillness or depth.
- **Crisis Addiction:** Creating or seeking emotional turbulence to feel alive.
- **Premature Expression:** Speaking about experiences before the emotional wave has provided clarity.

**Deconditioning:** Learn that **crisis is part of the cycle, not a problem**. Wait through the wave before sharing the experience—what you learned will be far clearer after the emotions settle.

## Gene Keys and Cross-System Synthesis

**Gate 35 Shadow (Hunger):** Insatiable craving for new experiences, never satisfied.
**Gate 35 Gift (Adventure):** Embracing change and experience with joy and curiosity.
**Gate 35 Siddhi (Boundlessness):** Recognition that all experience is infinite, interconnected.

**Gate 36 Shadow (Turbulence):** Emotional chaos, feeling lost in crisis.
**Gate 36 Gift (Humanity):** Compassion born from navigating emotional darkness.
**Gate 36 Siddhi (Compassion):** Deep, boundless compassion for all suffering.

**Tarot Resonance:** The Wheel of Fortune (X)—cycles of change, crisis, and renewal. The Moon (XVIII)—navigating emotional tides and darkness.

**Jungian Theme:** The **Crisis Archetype**—the descent into the underworld that transforms the psyche. Integration requires **embracing the dark night as teacher**.

---
## The Gift of Correctness

When aligned (waiting through the wave, informing before initiating), the 35-36 individual becomes the **experiential teacher**—the one who has lived through many transitions, navigated many crises, and **speaks the emotional truth** that comes only from direct experience. They embody **Adventure and Humanity**, and ultimately **Boundlessness and Compassion**—infinite openness born from navigating all emotional terrains.
