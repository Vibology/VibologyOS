# The BodyGraph
*Visual Map of Human Differentiation*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

The **BodyGraph** is the central visual representation of Human Design—a schematic map showing the configuration of the nine [[Centers]], sixty-four [[Gates]], and thirty-six Channels that comprise an individual's energetic architecture. Generated from precise birth data (date, time, location), the BodyGraph reveals the mechanical blueprint of human differentiation.

The BodyGraph synthesizes four ancient systems into a single visual language:
- **The I-Ching** (64 hexagrams → 64 Gates)
- **Astrology** (planetary activations)
- **The Kabbalah/Tree of Life** (Sephiroth → Centers)
- **The Hindu Chakra System** (energy centers)

## Components

### The Nine Centers
The geometric shapes within the BodyGraph represent the nine [[Centers]]—energy hubs governing specific themes (mental pressure, emotional chemistry, identity, willpower, etc.). Centers appear either:
- **Defined** (colored) — Consistent, reliable energy
- **Undefined** (white) — Receptive, sampling energy

### The 64 Gates
Small numbers positioned around and within Centers represent the [[Gates]]—archetypal themes corresponding to I-Ching hexagrams. Gates are activated by planetary positions at birth.

### The 36 Channels
Lines connecting Centers represent **Channels**—formed when both Gates at either end are activated. Channels create definition and consistent energy flow.

### Planetary Activations
The BodyGraph displays two sets of activations:
- **Personality (Conscious)** — Black markings, calculated at birth
- **Design (Unconscious)** — Red markings, calculated ~88 days before birth

## Reading the BodyGraph

The BodyGraph reveals:
- **Type** — Determined by Sacral and motor-to-Throat configuration
- **Authority** — Determined by defined Centers hierarchy
- **Profile** — Determined by Sun/Earth line positions
- **Definition** — How Centers connect (Single, Split, Triple Split, Quadruple Split, None)
- **Incarnation Cross** — Life purpose theme
