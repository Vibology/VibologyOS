# The 36 Channels
*Pathways of Defined Energy*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

**Channels** are the 36 defined pathways connecting the nine [[Centers]] in the Human Design [[The BodyGraph|BodyGraph]]. A Channel is formed when both [[Gates]] at either end are activated—one by the Personality (conscious) calculation and one by the Design (unconscious) calculation, or both by the same calculation.

When a Channel is complete:
- Both Centers it connects become **defined** (colored in)
- A consistent, reliable energy flow is established
- The Channel's theme becomes a fixed aspect of your nature

Channels are the **quantum** of definition in Human Design—the minimum unit that creates consistent energy.

## Channel Formation

### Complete Channels
Both gates activated = Channel defined = Both centers defined

**Example:** Gate 20 (Contemplation) + Gate 34 (Power) = Channel of Charisma (20-34)
- Connects Throat to Sacral
- Creates a Manifesting Generator configuration
- Theme: Power expressed in the now

### Hanging Gates
Only one gate activated = No channel = Potential for connection

Hanging gates create **electromagnetic attraction**—you are drawn to people who have the other half of your hanging gates.

## The Three Circuits

Channels are organized into three primary **Circuits**, each with distinct themes:

### Individual Circuit
**Theme:** Mutation, uniqueness, empowerment
**Keynote:** "I do it my way"

Channels that carry mutative, innovative energy. Individual circuitry doesn't care about the collective or tribe—it's about unique expression.

### Collective Circuit
**Theme:** Sharing, logic, abstraction
**Keynote:** "We understand together"

Two sub-circuits:
- **Logic:** Pattern recognition, proof, doubt → certainty
- **Sensing/Abstract:** Experience, reflection, desire → meaning

### Tribal Circuit
**Theme:** Support, loyalty, resources
**Keynote:** "We survive together"

Channels focused on family, community, bargains, and material support. Tribal energy is about "what's good for us."

## The 36 Channels

| Channel | Gates | Centers | Circuit | Theme |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| 1-8 | 1-8 | G-Throat | Individual | Inspiration → Creative Role Model |
| 2-14 | 2-14 | G-Sacral | Individual | The Beat → Keeper of Keys |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
