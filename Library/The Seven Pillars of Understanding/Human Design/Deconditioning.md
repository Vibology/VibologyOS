# Deconditioning
*The Seven-Year Return to Self*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

**Deconditioning** is the gradual process of releasing conditioned patterns and returning to your authentic design. In Human Design, it is said to take approximately **seven years**—one complete cellular renewal cycle—to fully decondition from the not-self patterns accumulated through a lifetime of living according to the mind rather than [[Inner Authority and Strategy|Authority and Strategy]].

Deconditioning is not self-improvement. It is **subtraction**—the removal of what you are not, revealing what you have always been.

## The Seven-Year Cycle

Ra Uru Hu taught that all cells in the body are replaced over a seven-year period. The deconditioning process aligns with this biological reality:

| Year | Phase | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1-2 | **Recognition** | Learning your design; beginning the experiment |
| 3-4 | **Resistance** | Encountering deep conditioning; mind's backlash |
| 5-6 | **Integration** | New patterns stabilizing; old ones dissolving |
| 7 | **Embodiment** | Living as yourself becomes natural |

This timeline is approximate. Deep conditioning from childhood may take longer; some patterns shift quickly.

## What Is Being Deconditioned

### Open/Undefined Centers

The primary sites of conditioning are your **undefined Centers**—the white areas in your [[The BodyGraph|BodyGraph]]. These Centers:
- Absorb and amplify energy from others
- Create the "not-self" patterns (trying to be what you're not)
- Generate the characteristic not-self themes by Center:

| Center | Not-Self Theme |
|--------|---------------|
| Head | Trying to answer everyone's questions |
| Ajna | Pretending to be certain |
| Throat | Trying to attract attention |
| G Center | Searching for identity and direction |
| Heart/Ego | Trying to prove yourself |
| Sacral | Not knowing when enough is enough |
| Solar Plexus | Avoiding confrontation and truth |
| Spleen | Holding on to what isn't healthy |
| Root | Always in a hurry |

### Conditioned Mind

Beyond the Centers, deconditioning addresses the **mind's usurpation of Authority**:
- Decisions made from fear, obligation, or comparison
- Mental strategies replacing bodily wisdom
- "Should" overriding authentic response

## The Experiment

Deconditioning happens through **living the experiment**—consistently applying [[Strategy]] and [[Authority]] to decisions:

1. **Notice** when you're about to make a decision
2. **Pause** and check: Is this my Authority or my mind?
3. **Follow** Strategy (Respond, Inform, Wait for Invitation, Wait the Lunar Cycle)
4. **Observe** the results over time
5. **Trust** what works; release what doesn't

The experiment is empirical: you test the mechanics against your lived experience.

## Signs of Deconditioning

**Early signs:**
- Noticing when you're in your not-self
- Catching yourself before mental override
- Growing trust in your Authority

**Middle signs:**
- Fewer wrong decisions
- More signature feelings (Satisfaction, Peace, Success, Surprise)
- Relationships with correct people

**Later signs:**
- Authority becomes automatic
- Less mental chatter about decisions
- Living your design feels natural, not effortful

---

## Challenges

- **The mind's resistance:** Conditioning served a purpose; the mind fears its loss
- **Social pressure:** Others may not understand your experiment
- **Patience:** Seven years is a long time in a culture of instant results
- **Not-self attractions:** Conditioned patterns can feel comfortable even when wrong
