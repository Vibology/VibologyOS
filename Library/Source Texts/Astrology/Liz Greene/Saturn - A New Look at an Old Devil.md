Meet Saturn’s Other Face

S
      aturn’s darker persona is recognized universally in myth and
      fairytale. Here, noted astrologer Liz Greene takes a major step in
      the unveiling of the light of reason, so long obscured by those who
have interpreted Saturn as a ‘malefic’ planet and, in so doing, presents a
                                                                                          Greene

    “Saturn symbolizes a psychic process as well as a quality or kind                                                                       6
  of experience. He is not merely a representative of pain, restriction,
  and discipline; he is also a symbol of the psychic process, natural to
  all human beings, by which an individual may utilize the experience
        of pain, restriction, and discipline, as a means for greater
                      consciousness and fulfillment.”                                                                   Liz Greene

  Greene retraces Saturn’s character through sign, house, aspect, and
  synastry in a brilliant analysis which reveals his other face: that of
    the initiator who, for the price of our honesty, offers us greater
     consciousness, self-understanding, and, eventually, freedom.

                Foreword

                         Many years after its initial publication it is difficult to overes-
                timate the importance of Liz Greene’s Saturn: A New Look at an Old
                Devil and what it represents. It was and is an important step in the
                progress of the twentieth century’s most crucial contribution to the
                evolution of astrology—namely, the use of astrology as a tool of self-
                realization and self-actualization.
                         Traditional forms of astrology derived from the Middle
                Eastern traditions--which include Hellenistic, Jyotish, and Medieval
                Astrology (both in Arabic and Latin)--seem to have assumed that
                the basic events and circumstances of one’s life were predetermined
                to a significant degree, if not completely. Those Hellenistic astrolo-
                gers strongly influenced by Stoicism show this tendency at its most
                extreme. The following passage from Manilius demonstrates this:

                           The fates rule the world, everything stands settled by law.

                           Long seasons are marked out by causes which are fixed.
                           As we are born, we are dying, and the end depends
                           upon the beginning.

                           From this both wealth and kingship flow, and, more
                           often there arises poverty. Skills and character are
                           granted to those thus created, also vice, praise, the
                           losses and the gathering of things.
                           —[Manilius, Astronomica Book IV, lines 14-19. My translation]

                        Islamic and Christian astrologers of the middle ages gave
                greater scope to free will in theory, but in practice this is not obvi-
                ous. Also, all three traditional forms of astrology held that there were
                “good” and “bad” planets, which later came to be called benefics and

              malefics, one of which was Saturn. Benefics “caused” good destinies,
              malefics evil ones.
                      However, even in the ancient world, there were voices which
              dissented from both of these ideas--that everything was determined
              at the moment of birth and that there were “good” and “bad” plan-
              ets--a concept which Saturn does much to undermine. The philoso-
              pher Plotinus (AD 204/5 –270) rejected both ideas in Enneads. His
              description of how the planets act could have been written by a mod-
              ern astrologer:

                       We may think of the stars as letters perpetually being
                       inscribed on the heavens or inscribed once for all and
                       yet moving as they pursue the other tasks allotted to
                       them: upon these main tasks will follow the quality of
                       signifying. . .
                       —Enneads 2.3.7, McKenna translation

                     He rejects the idea of good and bad planets in the following
              two passages:

                       The belief is that the planets in their courses actually
                       produce not merely such conditions as poverty, wealth,
                       health, and sickness, but even ugliness and beauty and,
                       gravest of all, vices and virtue and the very acts that
                       spring from these qualities, the definite doings of each
                       moment of virtue or vice. We are to suppose the stars
                       to be annoyed with men—and upon matters in which
                       men, molded to what they are by the stars themselves,
                       can surely do them no wrong.
                       —Enneads 2.3.1, McKenna translation

                       [The planets are]. . . continuously serene, happy in the
                       good they enjoy and the vision before them. Each lives
                       its own free life; each finds its own Good in its own
                       Act; and this Act is not directed towards us.

                  Foreword                                                                5

                           Other Platonists followed Plotinus in this respect, but this
                  had little impact on practical astrology. However, these passages serve
                  to tell us that even in ancient times the “traditional” view of astrology
                  was rejected by some, firmly, on philosophical grounds.
                           Despite the above exceptions among the ancients and a few medi-
                  eval philosophers who voiced similar objections, deterministic views and
                  the idea of benefic and malefic planets dominated astrology until the
                  twentieth century. It was the twentieth century and the astrology of the
                  modern West which saw the overthrow of these two positions.
                           Before Liz Greene’s work, others had taken steps--indeed large
                  steps--in this direction, most notably the late Dane Rudhyar (1895 -
                  1985) and some of his followers. Even as far back as the work of Alan
                  Leo (1860 - 1917) at the turn of the last century, one could see move-
                  ment in this direction. But in the case of Leo, this trend was enveloped
                  in a heavy layer of Theosophy, and it could be argued that self-actualiza-
                  tion in Leo’s work was much more directly part of his Theosophy and
                  only incidentally part of his astrology. One had to more or less adopt
                  his theosophical beliefs and practices in order to use astrology for self-
                  actualization. His Esoteric Astrology, much like the later work of the
                  same name by Alice Bailey, considerably changed and even distorted the
                  ancient symbolism of astrology in order to achieve its result, rather than
                  building on that symbolism and extending it to a new purpose.
                           Dane Rudyhar, who was a student of Bailey’s, took the next
                  step and used the true and authentic ancient symbolism of astrology as
                  it was to describe astrology as a tool of self-actualization. Works such
                  as his Astrology of Personalitycombined Bailey’s insights, along with
                  others gained from the psychology of Freud and Jung, to make it clear
                  that astrology could move from its medieval heritage of predicting
                  events and the external circumstances of life to reveal an understand-
                  ing of the inner processes of the soul. Rudyhar explored how these
                  influenced the individual’s life and, more importantly, how an under-
                  standing of these could give one freedom and self-determination; he
                  also roundly attacked the idea of benefic and malefic planets.
                           I do not mean to take away from Rudhyar’s value as an author
                  and the importance of his work in what I am about to say. His work
                  was written in language that was often obscure, abstract and very the-
                  oretical. His material gave one hope that it was possible to transcend
                  any particular astrological manifestation, but it did not offer any con-
                  crete ways to do this. It was for the next generation of astrologers to

              6                                                                Saturn

              begin to accomplish this task. Liz Greene’s Saturn was an important
              contribution to this work.
                       The format of the book is actually rather traditional.
              Superficially it appears to be a conventional handbook of delinea-
              tions. It takes up Saturn’s influence in the signs and houses, and in
              aspect to the other planets. I can say without taking away from Liz
              Greene’s accomplishment in this work that this was not an original
              arrangement; many handbooks of astrological delineations before did
              the same thing. But this more or less conventional way of organiz-
              ing the material was exactly what was needed to fill the gap between
              Rudhyar’s powerful but abstract descriptions and the needs of a seeker
              trying to find out what to do with his or her natal chart.
                        However, I must raise a bit of a quibble here, regarding the
              practice of equating the symbolism of planets in the houses with the
              symbolism of planets in the corresponding signs. For example, fol-
              lowing this belief, , Saturn in Aries acts like Saturn in the first house,
              Saturn in Taurus acts like Saturn in the second house, and so forth.
              Older, pre-modern astrology may be philosophically and spiritually
              limited, but its symbolic vocabulary is huge and rich. This equating
              of sign and house positions was never done except in melothesia, the
              assignment of signs and houses to parts of the body (Aries and first
              related to the head, Taurus and second relate to the throat, etc.) Signs
              and houses are very different kinds of symbolic entities, having very
              different functions. To equate them in this manner, I believe, is to con-
              fuse two very different symbol systems.
                       But even given my objection, I do not believe this is a great flaw
              in Saturn because Liz Greene’s emphasis here is clearly on the house
              placement over the sign placement and for this purpose the delinea-
              tions are masterful. The references to sign placement, even if signs and
              houses could be equated, would have to be of less value for the simple
              reason that Saturn spends two and a half years in a sign, and about two
              hours each day in a house. The house placements of a planet are much
              more characteristic of the individual person while the sign placements
              describe all persons born over an extended period of time.
                       The nature of the book’s descriptions of the combinations of
              Saturn with signs, houses, and other planets set it apart from the “cook-
              book” approach of previous works. It is not that Greene’s descriptions
              are more “accurate” (as if one could make a precise forecast of exactly
              how a planet will manifest in each setting). It is a matter of providing

                  Foreword                                                                   7

                  descriptions which enlarge the capacity of the individual to take con-
                  trol of his or her life. Instead of fully developed prescriptions for what
                  will happen, the reader is presented with a range of arguments derived
                  from the combination of symbols and then shown how changes in
                  consciousness and self-awareness can completely turn life manifesta-
                  tions around, turning those that are potentially difficult more creative
                  and fulfilling. Her descriptions are not mere “optimistic” descriptions
                  of possibilities that ignore the downside, but are instead descriptions
                  of the work that an individual needs to do in order to make creative
                  changes. Greene does not avoid describing the realizations that must
                  occur and tasks to be undertaken. It all requires a change in con-
                  sciousness and increased self-awareness. Here is an example from her
                  description of Saturn in the sixth house:

                            When a man is relatively unconscious, Saturn [in the
                            sixth] may be symbolic of discontent and resentment
                            because he may be aware only of the fact that he is in a
                            rut and that he is imprisoned by circumstances. . . .Yet
                            the meaning of the routine escapes him because he does
                            not truly understand the meaning of service. . . It is
                            said in esoteric teaching that service, rather than being
                            “good works”, is an innate quality of the inner man . . .
                            Service of this kind is the result of inner integration for
                            once the body and feelings and mind of a man are in
                            balance, he can then begin to become aware, intuitively,
                            of the purpose and nature of his inner psyche. . . Service
                            which is the result of inner balance is the potential
                            result of Saturn in the sixth house when he is expressing
                            in a conscious way.

                          As mentioned previously, even in medieval astrology it was
                  recognized that free will can alter an astrological indication. But this
                  belief was largely for religious reasons. If one did not have freedom of
                  will, then the freedom to choose salvation could not exist. It would
                  have made God, not the individual responsible for the individual’s
                  success or failure in achieving salvation through the planets. . But
                  while medieval astrologers paid lip service to this idea, it did not lead

              them to show how astrological influences could be modified by an act
              of will. It is not even very clear that they believed it could be done.
                       Saturn led the way in one of the triumphs of modern astrology
              in showing that a combination of acceptance, understanding, and the
              ability to perceive alternative choiceswith increased awareness is the
              variable that can change the way in which one experiences one’s chart
              and one’s life. And here is an important point! I firmly believe, and
              I believe that this book points to this, that the level of consciousness
              with which one approaches one’s own life is not fixed or determined by
              whatever the birth chart signifies. One’s potential level of self-aware-
              ness is not fated! It may be very difficult to change one’s consciousness
              as circumstances—family, friends, one’s cultural background— may
              seem to work against it at times, but it is always possible.
                       The choice of Saturn as the subject of this book was superb. Liz
              Greene has subsequently written several other similar works on other
              planets. But Saturn was the best place to begin precisely because Saturn
              is the planet that has most seemed to restrict freedom and fix destiny to
              astrologers. Many astrologers have seen Saturn as the planet of “karma”
              in the false but common sense of the word often used in the West, i.e.,
              as the distributer of an inevitable fate handed out as punishment or
              reward for deeds done in the pastor in previous lifetimes.
                       That even Saturn’s energy can be altered by the proper degree
              of wisdom and understanding opens up a way of seeing all of astrology
              in the same light. It is not necessary for one to go on an extreme spiri-
              tual path, to abandon one’s life in the world and take up the begging
              bowl to achieve this. Greene shows in countless examples how smaller
              “enlightenments” are available to us all if we approach things with the
              proper understanding. In traditional astrology Saturn was called the
              “greater malefic” (Mars being the “lesser”). Being the worse of the two
              traditional “malefics,” Saturn, makes it clear that this could be done
              with all of the symbols of the chart.
                       In this way Liz Greene’s Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil
              has become one of the key works in this most important contribution
              of twentieth century astrology to the development of astrology and
              the idea that astrology is not a map of one’s fixed destiny, but a poten-
              tial map of the unfolding of the authentic, higher self.
