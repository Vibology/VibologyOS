INTRODUCTION
The pursuit of ‘wretched subjects’

Ecstasy or vision begins when thought ceases, to our consciousness, to proceed from
ourselves. It differs from dreaming, because the subject is awake. It differs from
hallucinations, because there is no organic disturbance . . . Lastly, it differs
from poetical inspiration, because the imagination is passive. That perfectly sane
people often experience such visions there is no manner of doubt.1
—William Ralph Inge

The spirit of the depths from time immemorial and for all the future possesses a
greater power than the spirit of this time, who changes with the generations. The
spirit of the depths has subjugated all pride and arrogance to the power of judgement. He took away my belief in science, he robbed me of the joy of explaining
and ordering things, and he let devotion to the ideals of the time die out in me.
He forced me down to the last and simplest things.2
—C.G. Jung

Some domains of knowledge are easily distinguishable from each other: archaeology, for example, or zoology. Other domains, like medicine, are also easily identified,
but so broad that they require further clarification through subdivisions such as
gynaecology, cardiology, and orthopaedic surgery. Still other domains are resistant to any precise definition, even with myriad subdivisions, and might be viewed
as liminal. Liminal subjects tend to spread promiscuously through the interfaces
between disparate spheres of study such as religion, psychology, and magic, which
are themselves notoriously resistant to any universally agreed definition. It is these
enigmatic borderlands of human exploration that the historian Otto Neugebauer
once called ‘wretched subjects’.3 The manner in which C.G. Jung investigated,
adapted, and interpreted astrology – one of the most historically significant and

enduring, as well as one of the most poorly understood, of these liminal realms –
forms the subject of this book.4
Scholars like to know the names of things and the categories to which they
belong. To this end they have devised academic constructs such as ‘Neoplatonism’,
an appellation first created in the late eighteenth century to describe the religious
beliefs, philosophies, and practices of a group of individuals living between the
third and sixth centuries in widely disparate areas of the Roman Empire with differing cultural denominators. These individuals never called themselves ‘neo’, but
were attempting, in their own unique ways, to interpret Plato’s work according to
their personal perspectives and experiences.5 They shared a love of Plato’s ideas
and a conviction that there was still a great deal within the Platonic opus that merited further elucidation. ‘Neoplatonism’ is a useful category because it locates these
individuals within a roughly identifiable time frame, a more or less recognisable
philosophical system, and a broad cultural context. But as a definitive label, ‘Neoplatonism’ can obscure the enormous differences between the ideas and doctrines
promulgated, for example, by Plotinus (c. 204–270 ce), whose Enneads exercised a
lasting influence on Christian theology, and Iamblichus (c. 245–325 ce), the head of
the Platonic academy in Syria, whose text on theurgy, De mysteriis, was particularly
attractive to the occultists of the late nineteenth century.6 Likewise, ‘Neoplatonism’
can obscure the enormous differences in the interpretation – or, as it is currently
understood, the ‘reception’7 – of these authors from the time of their writing to
the present day.
Another example of an apparently precise but highly misleading academic classification is the term ‘Renaissance’. From the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth
century, it seemed perfectly clear to historians what was meant by ‘the Renaissance’:8 it spanned the period between the early fifteenth and mid-seventeenth
century, fuelled by the translation from Greek into Latin of classical and late antique
texts once lost to the West but made accessible through the fall of Constantinople
to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.9 The Italian Renaissance, viewed from this perspective, represents a dramatically sudden, spontaneously generated rebirth of ancient
pagan philosophy and art in a Western Christian context, epitomised by the paintings of Botticelli and da Vinci; the sculptures of Michelangelo; the Platonic and
Hermetic philosophical elucidations of Marsilio Ficino; the Kabbalistic explications
of Pico della Mirandola; the poetry of Petrarch, Boccaccio, and Angelo Poliziano;
and the scientific genius of Galileo and Copernicus.10 It also heralded a resurgence
of the three ‘occult sciences’ of antiquity – astrology, alchemy, and magic11 – which
were later to prove so fascinating to Jung. But this definition of ‘Renaissance’ has
been contested within the academy for more than fifty years.12 A period of great
religious and scientific expansion between 1050 and 1250 is now referred to as
the ‘twelfth-century Renaissance’ and, like the later Italian Renaissance, it also
involved the importation of texts on magic, astrology, and alchemy, this time from
the Jewish and Muslim worlds of southern Spain and the Middle East. The Italian Renaissance is now seen as the inevitable outgrowth of the twelfth-century
Renaissance, enhanced by the development of printed books, which eventually

led to the Reformation and what is now known as the early modern period in
Western history.13 Categories such as ‘early modern’ may themselves, over time, be
reviewed and revised. The historiography of any place or period of human culture,
and any genre of human creativity, is as revealing and complex as the history itself.14
Many people outside the academy have no difficulty in identifying themselves
as ‘religious’. But scholars continue to argue ferociously about the definition of the
term ‘religion’ according to criteria that might mean nothing at all to those who
firmly place their trust in the ineffable through direct experience, but never enter
a collectively recognised place of worship or call their divinity by a conventionally
acknowledged name.15 Because many of these individuals have no intention of ever
setting foot in a church, chapel, synagogue, mosque, or temple, their perspectives are
deemed to be either ‘New Age cults’ – as is the case with many contemporary spiritualities16 – or part of the modern process of ‘secularisation’: another constructed
category, like ‘Neoplatonism’, which serves the purposes of the academy but does
not faithfully reflect, and may even grossly misrepresent, the highly individual ideas,
beliefs, experiences, and aspirations of those grouped under such labels.17
Even the term ‘modern’ is open to question. We might think of ourselves as
‘modern’, and speak of the ‘modern’ world, or even the ‘post-modern’. Psychology
is understood to be a ‘modern’ science; astrology, in contrast, is deemed to be ‘premodern’, and its indestructible popularity has continued to baffle sociologically
inclined researchers. But is modernity a precise period of history that began at the
time of the ‘Enlightenment’ (another academic construct) at the end of the eighteenth century? Is modernity an evolutionary step in social progress, or a regressive
one? Is it the product of industrialisation, secularisation, science, or ‘disenchantment’?18 Is ‘modern’ a perspective that has occurred many times in history, perhaps
in a cyclical fashion, reflecting a certain way of viewing reality? Or does ‘modern’
simply refer to a fluid category which people have used throughout history, albeit
under other names, to differentiate themselves from a perceived ‘primitive’ past?19
Academically constructed categories, even when they implacably disagree or
are subject to constant revision, are useful, not least because, in a scholarly work,
it is advisable to make oneself understood by stating clearly what one means by
a particular term. But these categories must necessarily remain hypothetical and
fluid, because no two cultures, and no two individuals, will ever precisely agree
about what constitutes religion, magic, or psychology. Astrology too, usually perceived by historians as a monolithic entity under the rubric of ‘divination’,20 needs
to be understood as a pluralistic cultural product. There have always been many
astrologies in terms of the diverse cosmologies, philosophies, techniques, modes
of interpretation, and material and spiritual applications developed by astrological
practitioners.21 Although the symbolic representations of Western astrology have
remained relatively consistent over many centuries,22 Jung’s psychologically orientated astrological approach is very different from the Aristotelian astrology of
Ptolemy in the second century, which in turn differs from the magical astrology
of the adepts of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in the late nineteenth
century and the Theosophical astrology of Alan Leo in the early twentieth, rooted

in H.P. Blavatsky’s reinterpretation of Neoplatonic and Gnostic ideas about the
spiritual evolution of the soul.
In recent decades, cultural specificity has become a powerful tool within the
academy for ensuring that scholarly definitions of spheres of human activity such
as ‘religion’ remain fluid. But at the same time, these definitions are, paradoxically, expected to provide clear and stable boundaries between discrete areas of
human experience that might be more subtly intertwined than at first perceived.
For example, one can be a psychologist of religion, but it is not easy to be a psychologist who is overtly religious without risking a loss of credibility in the eyes of
those who view psychology solely as a science.23 Sonu Shamdasani has pointed out
that much of the controversy surrounding Jung’s work rests on the fact that he was
‘one of the most prominent modern psychologists to affirm religious values’.24 One
can be a scholar of magic, or a scholar of astrology, yet one cannot practice ritual
magic or astrology without serious questions being asked about one’s academic
‘empiricism’25 – even though it is problematic, and perhaps even impossible, to discuss such fields intelligently without any direct experience of them. As Shamdasani
states, Jung’s ‘non-derisive attention to such subjects was enough to brand him as an
occultist’.26 When non-derisiveness leads to direct experimentation (as it did with
Jung), genuinely relevant questions, such as what valuable psychological insights
might be gained from such experimentation, are not asked by critics. Prejudice
and uninformed opinion, and even personal hostility, may replace ‘methodological
agnosticism’ and the testimony of individual experience.27
Even figures from the ancient world can suffer from this kind of anachronistic
imposition of present-day cultural paradigms. The reputation of Iamblichus, who
was labelled a ‘magician’ by the religious historian E.R. Dodds in the mid-­twentieth
century, has never entirely recovered from the assumption that rational philosophy
and theurgic mysticism are mutually exclusive; Iamblichus is still, despite recent
scholarly efforts in the last two decades, viewed by some academics as a ‘depraved
occultist’.28 As Zeke Mazur has pointed out in a paper on the magical roots of
Plotinus’ ‘rational’ mysticism: ‘Much of the previous scholarship has consciously
or unconsciously assumed that magic is a category radically distinct from both
philosophy and “high” religion’.29 And while the ‘rehabilitation’ of theurgically
inclined Neoplatonists such as Iamblichus is finally being pursued in some quarters,
this kind of common-sense neutrality does not always extend into the domain of
academic psychology. The work of psychologists and psychotherapists who spend
too much time exploring the liminal zones does not often meet with an unbiased
reception.
In the world of ‘wretched subjects’, precise categories tend to dissolve, merge,
and mate with each other to generate new hybrids. The insights gained from direct
experience may prove as important as intellectual analyses and scientific methodologies, and blurred boundaries are the norm. However disturbing this might
be, ideas with enormous agency and longevity can be seen in their most dynamic
forms, while they are still in the process of transforming and creatively adapting to
particular cultural milieux but have not yet been bludgeoned into codified inertia

by the requirements of specific academic, socio-economic, and political concerns.
‘Wretched subjects’, however plentiful and important the documentary evidence,
still form an academic wilderness, relatively unexplored until very recently, in which
there are no neat, inarguable rules for scholastic methodology or religious ontology.
This can prove uncomfortable, and the temptation to turn the wilderness into a
carefully manicured garden through the application of intellectual secateurs, herbicides, and insecticides is sometimes irresistible. But it is only when these spheres are
explored from within as well as without that genuinely creative thinking is possible.
Jung spent a great deal of time in the liminal interfaces between psychology and
religion, psychology and magic, magic and mysticism, and mysticism and medicine.
Like any individual, he was vulnerable to the dominant values of his time and his
culture, and he suffered enormously each time he ventured beyond the barbed-wire
fence surrounding and protecting his chosen profession of psychiatry and sought
psychological insights in what are now understood to be ‘esoteric’ subjects. It is
unclear whether the subjects Jung studied are indeed ‘esoteric’; this depends on
how the term is defined and in which historical period the definition has arisen.30
Astrology is often considered an ‘esoteric’ sphere of study, but until the end of the
eighteenth century it was ‘mainstream’ and, despite continuing efforts to obstruct
its practice or challenge its legitimacy at various historical junctures, it has remained
an intrinsic, albeit sometimes covert, aspect of the religious cosmologies of both
East and West. Many of the subjects which Jung studied blend different spheres
of human experience: art serves as an instrument of magic, astrological symbols
yield psychological insight, dream-images open gateways to religious experiences
disguised as madness, God and the unconscious become indistinguishable, medicine
joins hands with shamanic ritual, and sexuality is a holy magical rite. However, the
label ‘esoteric’ can be a comforting one for scholars because, once this term has
been given fixed boundaries,31 it is no longer necessary to tolerate the uncertainty
of whether what Jung did was psychology or religion, or whether attempting to
distinguish between the two might be asking the wrong question. In the view
of many academics, Jung was not a proper psychologist, but rather an ‘esotericist’
with a ‘religionist’ bias whose work is rooted in the German Romanticism of the
nineteenth century.32 That, apparently, places him safely in a recognisable category
where, until very recently, it was assumed that, like a tricky jinn in a bottle, he would
quietly remain.
In the autumn of 2009, a new work by Jung titled The Red Book: Liber Novus
was finally released for publication.33 Close to the time of his death in 1961, Jung
made the following comments about the period of his life when he was engaged
in creating Liber Novus:
The years when I was pursuing my inner images were the most important
in my life – in them everything essential was decided. It all began then; the
later details are only supplements and clarifications of the material that burst
forth from the unconscious, and at first swamped me. It was the prima materia
for a lifetime’s work.34

Introduction

Liber Novus, known as The Red Book because of its red leather binding, is Jung’s calligraphic revision of a series of private diaries, known as the Black Books, covering
the period from 1913 – the time of his break with Freud – to 1932. The work is
both textual and pictorial. Virtually every page contains a painted image, all of them
strikingly beautiful and impeccably executed, and the calligraphic writing mimics
a medieval illuminated manuscript. The dominant narrative of Liber Novus is Jung’s
journey from alienation to the restoration of his soul, through the long and painful process of integrating a rift within his own nature: the seemingly irreconcilable
conflict between reason and revelation, outer and inner worlds, subjectivity and
objectivity, and between the scientist and the religious visionary, both of whom
he experienced as authentic, demanding, and mutually exclusive dimensions of his
own being.
The existence of Liber Novus had been an open secret once Jung’s autobiographical memoir, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, was published in German in 1961
and in English in 1962,35 as he described the genesis of Liber Novus in this work;
and unpublished copies of Liber Novus had been circulating among Jung’s close colleagues for some time. But it had never been accessible to a wider reading public,
nor even to the majority of analytical psychologists outside Jung’s own intimate
circle. Now its publication has inspired a proliferation of books, articles, workshops,
interviews, lectures, and commentaries, ranging from reviews in newspapers, internet seminars, and interpretations in analytic journals to the websites of modern
pagan groups, one of which, with considerable justification, declared online that
Liber Novus is ‘the most important grimoire of our modern age’.36
Jung’s reputation in the world of clinical psychology has always been ambiguous.
Often viewed as a mystic or even, in the view of the Freudian analyst D.W. Winnicott, a schizophrenic who somehow managed to heal himself,37 Jung’s theoretical
models have been deemed questionable because they are insufficiently ‘scientific’.
It is difficult to demonstrate through repetitive experiments the existence and location of the archetypes of the collective unconscious.38 Current paradigms of clinical psychology tend to favour cognitive approaches to the human mind, which are
more amenable to the methodologies of the natural sciences.39 According to David
Tacey, a professor of psychoanalysis at La Trobe University in Melbourne, one of
the reasons why Jung has been marginalised within university psychology departments is that ‘his work does not fit any specific academic discipline. Staff in psychology are likely to refer to it as religious studies’.40
Surprisingly, the view of Jung as ‘unscientific’ has also been promulgated in
the academic sphere of esoteric studies, an area of scholarship that has, until quite
recently, itself been marginalised, and where one might reasonably expect a more
methodologically neutral and practitioner-tolerant approach. This perception of
Jung suggests that, because he drew on esoteric sources in formulating his psychological models, he should be viewed as an esotericist, since esotericism and
psychology are evidently mutually exclusive.41 An example of this kind of approach
is offered by Richard Noll, whose apparently scholarly treatment of Jung has been



Introduction

challenged in terms of its neutrality, and even its veracity. G. William Barnard,
describing Noll’s work, suggests:
It also seems that underneath Noll’s seemingly impeccable academic good
intentions, other more emotionally charged motives are at work. Noll does
not simply offer a neutral, detached depiction of Jung. Instead, in much the
same way as other academics who are contemptuous of various ‘lowbrow’
psychology-as-a-religion perspectives, it could be argued that Noll seeks to
discredit Jung, simply because of his affiliation with a number of esoteric and
occult movements active at that time in Europe.42
It might be argued that Barnard has been excessively courteous in his evaluation of
Noll. John Haule, a Zürich-trained Jungian analyst describing various biographies
of Jung, simply dismisses Noll as a ‘muckraker’.43 Sonu Shamdasani, in Cult Fictions,
likewise removes the velvet glove and highlights with impeccable scholarship the
dishonesty and malice with which Noll constructed his project of Jung-bashing.44
Jung has also been interpreted by some scholars as a philosopher of religion who
covertly utilised psychological models to support metaphysical claims. This apparently renders his psychological theories dubious because he concealed his belief
in the existence of God under the cloak of the psychological analysis of religious
experience.45 Religious belief, as Ann Bedford Ulinov has wryly suggested, could
‘contaminate the learning process with a proselytizing fervor’.46
Although it has not yet been empirically demonstrated that a belief in God is
mutually exclusive with the capacity to generate useful scientific research, nevertheless there seems to be an unspoken assumption that one must be an atheist or,
at the very least, an agnostic in order to produce a legitimate scientific psychology.
This perspective relies on particular assumptions about the nature of psychology as
a science best pursued within the broader framework of medicine. These assumptions, a reflection of the early twentieth-century fixation on ‘scientism’, plagued
Jung himself. But they are open to serious challenge today, not only by therapeutic
practitioners of various persuasions, but by those historians who have remembered
Thomas Kuhn’s trenchant observation that science, rather than steadily accumulating incontrovertible truths, tends to lurch from paradigm to paradigm.47 However,
the tensions around Jung’s position in the academy, despite the frequency of uninformed opinions and lack of direct experience of the analytic process, reflect with
precision Jung’s own profound conflict between scientifically demonstrable ‘truths’
and visionary experience.
Despite Jung’s ambiguous place within the world of clinical psychology, his
influence has been pervasive in the various currents of transpersonal psychology.48
In theological circles, he has long been favoured by psychologically inclined theologians, since belief, in this context, ‘is not held to be a drawback but a resource’.49
The spiritual journey presented in Liber Novus is likely to enhance rather than
detract from Jung’s influence in this sphere.50 In the field of literature, Jung’s ideas

Introduction

glow like fluorescent threads within the work of novelists such as James Joyce,
Hermann Hesse, and Thomas Mann,51 and scholars of twentieth-century literature, in addition to exploring these threads, frequently utilise Jungian models as
a methodology to explore the major themes in literary texts.52 For many decades
Jung’s ideas also exercised an enormous influence on historians of religion such as
Mircea Eliade, Gilles Quispel, Henry Corbin, and Pierre Riffard, who examined
the repeating themes of myth and ritual across cultures and historical epochs and
embraced Jung’s idea of archetypal patterns as reflections of the deepest dynamics
of the human imagination. Quispel referred to these patterns as ‘basic structures
of religious apperception’; Riffard called them ‘anthropological structures’, implying a transcultural human predisposition to generate religious ideas according to
specific patterns of thought.53 The Eranos conferences, which began in 1933 and
were held annually in Ascona, Switzerland, until 1976, were inspired by Jung’s work
and attracted the participation of Eliade and Corbin as well as Gershom Scholem,
the founder of modern scholarly research into the Jewish Kabbalah. These scholars
were all variously influenced by Jung’s theory of archetypes, and focused on the
generic features of religions and the centrality of mystical experience rather than
on culturally specific forms of worship and their social and political dimensions.
For many decades their approach influenced scholarship on religion throughout
the world.54
But all paradigms, as Kuhn wisely observed, have a finite life, and it seems that,
like the heavenly bodies, they move in cycles. In zoological taxonomy, for example,
the debate between ‘lumpers’ (those who group different subpopulations of a particular animal genus together and emphasise their similarities as a single species) and
‘splitters’ (those who focus on differences and give each subpopulation a separate
species name) echoes the ongoing debate in historical and religious studies between
‘universalist’ and ‘culture-specific’ approaches.55 The culture-specific approach to
the history of religions now dominant within the academy has served as a necessary
corrective to the dangers of grand ‘metanarratives’,56 but it can sometimes be taken
to extremes. From this perspective, Jung’s theories are ‘universalist’ or ‘essentialist’
and are therefore unsound57 – although Jung himself continually emphasised the
cultural adaptability and fluidity of mythic themes.58 Jung’s method of ‘amplification’ to achieve better understanding of a symbol through comparison with other
symbols is not, as is sometimes assumed, a means of abstracting universal ‘categories’, but rather, a way of entering into, and experiencing, the dynamic dimensions
of the symbol itself:59
The essence of hermeneutics . . . consists in adding more analogies to that
already given by the symbol . . . The initial symbol is much enlarged and
enriched by this procedure, the result being a highly complex and manysided picture . . . Thence result certain psychological lines of development of
an individual as well as collective nature. No science upon earth could prove
the accuracy of these lines . . . But these lines vindicate their validity by their
value for life.60



Introduction

It was this approach that Jung adopted in his use of astrological symbols as a form
of hermeneutics.
The tendency within contemporary esoteric circles to validate occult philosophies through Jung’s psychological models has been referred to as ‘Jungianism’.61
This term is applicable to twentieth-century astrologers such as Dane Rudhyar
(1895–1985) and Alexander Ruperti (1913–1998), who selected particular themes
in Jung’s work and used them to justify a range of Theosophically orientated
interpretations.62 Jung’s influence on contemporary astrologies has certainly been
potent, not least because he himself practiced astrology: the influence flowed both
ways. But the object of this book is not to dismiss Jung’s psychological theories as
a modernisation of esoteric doctrines adapted to the requirements of a ‘scientistic’
modern age.63 Jung’s astrology helped to shape his psychological models from the
writing of Liber Novus onward, and modern astrology has been profoundly reshaped
by Jung’s psychological concepts. This neither confirms nor denies the validity of
either field of study. It simply underlines the importance of exploring both spheres
as thoroughly as possible if one seeks to understand the genesis and development of
a psychological system whose influence, despite the criticisms of academic psychology, continues to grow. Jung’s highly eclectic library, his friendships with individuals
such as the Theosophist G.R.S. Mead, and his correspondence with astrologers
such as André Barbault, John M. Thorburn, and B.V. Raman, took him far beyond
the boundaries of the world of the Burghölzli Clinic, allowing ideas outside that
clinical environment to fertilise the development of his psychological models.64
These models, in turn, have subsequently had enormous impact on many spheres of
human exploration beyond what is academically, or even colloquially, understood
as psychology.
A figure as influential as Jung in the fields of psychology, literature, philosophy, theology, history, and contemporary spiritualities will inevitably be the subject
of many biographies and analyses. Some of these are hagiographic, some objectively affirmative, some conscientiously neutral, some objectively critical, and some
aggressively hostile. A number of recent scholarly works on Jung, predating the
publication of Liber Novus, have explored some of the sources that inspired his
psychological models. These investigations examine Jung’s early involvement in
spiritualism as well as the various unconventional approaches to ‘subliminal’ psychology current in the early years of the twentieth century.65 Jung’s preoccupation
with the Gnostics of late antiquity has been the source of further works,66 and his
links with German Romantic currents has provided fuel for a number of academic
papers.67 Various authors have noted Jung’s connection with Mead, suggesting that
Jung’s early understanding of Gnostic, Orphic, and Hermetic materials depended
largely on Mead’s Theosophically inclined translations and elucidations.68 Earlier
psychological and philosophical models, such as Henri Bergson’s élan vital, Hans
Driesch’s ‘vitalism’, and Eugen Bleuler’s die Psychoide, have also been considered,69
as has Jung’s reliance on the philosophical explorations of Nietzsche, Schopenhauer,
and Kant.70 All these perspectives are highly relevant in understanding the genesis
of Jung’s ideas; he did not espouse exclusively any single current of thought or body

of doctrines, but sought corroboration for his own experiences and those of his
patients in an enormous variety of sources, many of them denizens of the liminal
realms.
Jung’s astrology has never been the subject of an in-depth investigation, even by
analytical psychologists, despite an impressively large number of references in his
published works and letters. Recently a welcome and much-needed compilation of
Jung’s references to astrology has been published, focusing for the first time on this
singularly important dimension of his thought.71 But this volume, part of a series of
volumes presenting Jung’s views on various subjects, is a compilation rather than a
monograph, and is not intended to explore the historical sources of his interest and
expertise in astrology. It is possible that some Jungian analysts, when discussing the
work of their founding father, cannot easily countenance any tainting of his reputation by ‘wretched subjects’ that are still very much alive but treated with contempt
by the scientific community – not least because such an association can be, and has
been, used by hostile critics to justify their dismissal of the validity of Jung’s psychology. Consequently, little attention has been paid to Jung’s own statements: that
he began studying astrology while he was still working with Freud ‘in order to find
a clue to the core of psychological truth’;72 that he used natal horoscopes to better
understand the unconscious dynamics of his patients ‘in cases of difficult psychological diagnosis’;73 that he recommended that any person training as a psychotherapist should learn astrology;74 and that astrology’s value ‘is obvious enough to the
psychologist, since astrology represents the sum of all the psychological knowledge
of antiquity’.75 These are weighty statements, yet their full significance is usually
acknowledged only by astrological practitioners. Nor has any research been done
on the large number of interpretations of his own horoscope that Jung requested
from astrological practitioners, especially in Britain and the United States, and the
numerous horoscopes of patients, friends, and family members, in both his own and
Emma Jung’s handwriting, that are found in his private archives.
Jung’s published statements and, even more, the documentary evidence of his
private papers, make clear the fact that astrology was of immense importance to
him, personally and in his psychological work. Yet this importance has largely
been ignored. Also ignored is the fact that the various late antique cosmologies
with which Jung was preoccupied while he worked on Liber Novus – Gnostic,
Neoplatonic, Orphic, Hermetic – were, as he himself noted, based on an astrological cosmology that focused on the celestial origin of the human soul, the dilemma
of planetary fate, and the journey of the soul, assisted by theurgic ritual, toward its
transformation and freedom beyond the compulsions of the planetary spheres.76
Jung’s persistent concern with astral fate as inner compulsion, his interpretation of
fate in the context of ‘individuation’, and his use of theurgy in psychotherapy, are
not subjects ordinarily discussed in works on the development and application of
his ideas.
In order to fully explore Jung’s astrology, this book examines these older cosmologies and the interpretations and applications Jung developed, based on what
he found in the primary sources and in the later scholarly interpretations available

to him. My second book, The Astrological World of Jung’s ‘Liber Novus’, focuses on
Liber Novus itself, and the ways in which astrology infuses both the text and the
images of this remarkable personal and, at the same time, mythic human journey. If,
as Jung himself declared, the years he spent working on Liber Novus provided the
raw material for all his later theories, then astrology, as Jung understood and worked
with it, is unquestionably one of the most important foundation stones of analytical
psychology and needs to be acknowledged as such, without prejudice and with the
same methodological agnosticism that Ninian Smart recommended long ago for all
scholars, whatever their domain of research.

JUNG’S UNDERSTANDING
OF ASTROLOGY

Although I must admit the use of Astrology in foretelling the outcome of certain
causes, it is not of vital moment . . . This consideration, of course, opens up the
whole question of Fate versus Freewill, and it at once determines the difference
between the ‘exoteric’ and the ‘esoteric’ astrologer. The former is a confirmed
fatalist, who believes himself forever under the bane of Destiny . . . The esoteric
astrologer has no such creed. His faith is based upon the belief that as a man sows,
so he must reap; his motto is ‘Man, Know Thyself ’.1
—Alan Leo

The sun, moon and planets were the exponents, so to speak, of certain psychological or psychical constituents of the human character; and this is why astrology can give more or less valid information about character . . . The religious
mysteries of later antiquity were all concerned with freeing man from the Heimarmene; in other words, with freeing him from the compulsive quality of the
foundations of his own character.2
—C.G. Jung

Astrology in the early twentieth century
As befits its liminal nature, astrology is open to many definitions. Making sense of
Jung’s astrology requires placing it in some kind of context: how was it viewed in
the West at the time Jung began his studies? Patrick Curry has offered an admirably
comprehensive description of astrology: it is ‘the practice of relating the heavenly
bodies to lives and events on earth, and the tradition that has thus been generated’.3
Astronomy involves the observation and measurement of the heavenly bodies, but
astrology assigns meaning to them in relation to human experience. Although a history of Western astrology during the years Jung worked on Liber Novus is beyond
the scope of this book,4 nevertheless the varying approaches to astrology current in



16 Jung’s understanding of astrology

the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are relevant to Jung’s understanding of it.
Astrology as a method of predicting events was as ubiquitous in esoteric circles
at the fin de siècle as it had been in the Middle Ages; with few exceptions, Germanspeaking astrologers writing at the time Jung began work on Liber Novus pursued
astrology as a method of foretelling the future.5 There was no specific German
astrological ‘movement’ until the mid-1920s,6 and the psychologically orientated
astrology that subsequently began to develop in the German-speaking world relied
heavily on Jung’s own publications. But two other types of astrology, with antecedents in late antiquity, emerged in Britain at the turn of the century and gradually
began to influence astrologers in both Europe and America. These ‘new’ astrologies – although they were in fact not new at all – were largely due to the work
of the Theosophical Society, founded by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky in 1875, and
the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, founded by William Wynn Westcott,
Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, and William Robert Woodman in 1888.7
Theosophical astrologers such as Alan Leo, whose work is discussed in greater detail
in the next chapter, were concerned with what the natal horoscope might indicate about the individual’s spiritual development, while occultist astrologers such
as Frederick Hockley and MacGregor Mathers, both practicing magicians, adapted
astrology to magical rituals derived from Neoplatonic texts and the Kabbalistic
astral magic of the medieval period. Their application of astrology concerned the
invocation of celestial potencies through the use of astrological symbols, sigils, and
talismans in order to achieve individual psychological and spiritual transformation.8
Although astrologers involved in the Golden Dawn and other occult societies used
horoscopes for characterological and divinatory purposes, particularly in assessing
the suitability of a neophyte for initiation and the correct timing of a magical
ritual, their focus was more interior and provided a prototype for the psychological
approach to astrology that Jung himself developed.9
Although no evidence has yet emerged indicating that Jung was acquainted with
the work of Hockley and MacGregor Mathers, he was familiar with the writings of
other members of the Golden Dawn, and he had acquired a range of older magical
texts with a similar emphasis during the time he worked on Liber Novus.10 Jung’s
friendship with the former secretary of the Theosophical Society, G.R.S. Mead,11
and his reliance on Theosophically inclined astrologers for horoscopic interpretations, suggest that it was in the British esoteric community that he found the greatest inspiration for his psychological understanding of astrology. From the outset, it
seems that Jung, although not immune to the desire to speculate on the future, was
not primarily interested in the literal prediction of events. Instead, he concerned
himself with psychological events, and sought to understand what the horoscope as
a symbolic map might reveal in terms of the individual psyche and its unfoldment
over time. He maintained this position throughout his life. In a lengthy letter to the
French astrologer André Barbault, written in 1954, Jung declared:
There are many instances of striking analogies between astrological constellations and psychological events . . . Astrology, like the collective unconscious



Jung’s understanding of astrology

17

with which psychology is concerned, consists of symbolic configurations: the
‘planets’ are the gods, symbols of the powers of the unconscious . . . I would
say that the astrologer does not always consider his statements to be mere
possibilities. The interpretation is sometimes too literal and not symbolic
enough.12
It has always been an open secret in analytical circles that Jung was deeply involved
with astrology. However, even within this knowledgeable community, considerable
discomfort has been demonstrated by some analysts, and some Jungian training
groups, about such an apparently questionable predilection.13 There were times
when Jung himself felt it necessary to hide the extent of his interest in astrology,
even from his own colleagues. In a letter to Michael Fordham (1905–95), who
founded the Society for Analytical Psychology in London in 1946 and who assisted
in the English publication of Jung’s Collected Works, Jung, defending the astrological
research described in his two essays on synchronicity,14 wrote:
You really need not believe a word of astrology in order to make a horoscope
or statistics. I am reasonably skeptical and yet I can make and try out all sorts
of mantic experiments. I can even repeat some absurd alchemical procedures
without the slightest conviction, for sheer curiosity. You can also attend a
mass without believing in transsubstantiation [sic] and a communist meeting
without believing in Stalin.15
This letter was dated 15 December 1954, just seven months after Jung’s letter to
Barbault describing the ‘striking analogies’ between astrological configurations
and psychological events. It is unlikely that Jung experienced a sudden change
of heart toward astrology during those months, or that he would have attempted
to gratuitously flatter a professional astrologer like Barbault. Rather, Jung seems
to have found it wiser to disguise his astrological research as a ‘mantic experiment’, while attempting at the same time to explain to Fordham in further letters, as diplomatically as possible, that the various criticisms of his experiment
were due to ‘a profound lack of astrological knowledge’,16 and that the statistical
results were ‘most complimentary to astrology’.17 There is no indication that
Fordham was ever convinced.18 Jung’s concern about keeping his astrological
work under wraps is also evident in a letter written in 1953 by the American
psychotherapist Ira Progoff (1921–1998), who studied with Jung in Zürich from
1952 to 1955, to Cary F. Baynes, who translated a number of Jung’s works into
English:
You’ll be very interested to know that Dr. J. has advised me to study Astrology when I get back . . . He says that every analyst should be equipped with it
because there are borderline cases where it gives a very valuable clue. I don’t
think he would like it known that he holds Astrology in such respect. Altho,
he did say that he doesn’t feel that he needs to be as cautious about it as he
used to be.19



18 Jung’s understanding of astrology

Progoff ’s horoscope, drawn in an unknown hand, is one of the large collection of
charts of patients and colleagues in Jung’s private archives.
Jung’s absorption in alchemical symbolism may be more acceptable in analytic
circles because alchemy is safely separated from the modern world by a decent
historical interval and can be viewed as a curious hiccup in the history of science.
And in any event, Jung was not a practicing alchemist in any literal sense. But
astrology, being part of the modern as well as the ancient and medieval worlds, is
apparently not something with which a rationally inclined psychologist should
become involved, particularly in the extremely simplistic forms in which it is
presented in the popular press. Andrew Samuels, in his comprehensive work, Jung
and the Post-Jungians, never mentions Jung’s preoccupation with Heimarmene, the
late antique concept of astral fate,20 and makes only one dismissive reference to
astrology.21 Robert Segal, a prolific writer and lecturer on Jung’s ideas, never
discusses Jung’s predilection for astral lore, even in Segal’s lengthy introduction
to a selection of Jung’s discussions on Gnosticism – a religious current firmly
rooted in an astral cosmology and deeply concerned with astrological fate as inner
compulsion.22
Attempting to interpret an author’s work selectively, according to the prejudices of the interpreter and the prevailing fashions of the academy, is hardly a new
phenomenon in scholarship. The imposition of ‘researcher’s bias’ has been going
on since the Greek allegorists argued about what Orpheus ‘really’ meant, Iamblichus and Porphyry disagreed about the ‘true’ Platonic world-view, and Christian
theologians insisted they had discovered the concealed ‘signatures’ of their own
truths in both the Torah and the Jewish Kabbalah.23 Attempting to cleanse the
reputation of a great scientific thinker from the taint of ‘wretched subjects’ has
been consistently applied by modern scholars to such figures as Galileo, who, in
addition to his acknowledged contribution to the history of science, was a committed astrologer as well as an astronomer.24 However, apart from the age-old phenomenon of ‘researcher’s bias’ and its vagaries, and independent of the extensive
and revealing astrological documents in Jung’s private archives, the Collected Works
alone, as well as Jung’s published letters to Freud and others, reflect even to the
lay reader, clearly and inarguably, Jung’s ongoing and extremely serious concern
with the philosophy, nature, and practical applications of astrology as a form of
psychological exegesis.

The libido and the qualities of time
From his published correspondence, it appears that Jung began his exploration of
astrology in the spring of 1911, while he was still working with Freud.25 In a letter
to Freud, dated 8 May of that year, Jung wrote:
At the moment I am looking into astrology, which seems indispensable for a
proper understanding of mythology. There are strange and wondrous things
in these lands of darkness.26



Jung’s understanding of astrology

19

Freud’s reply was not antagonistic, but he expressed anxiety at this latest display of
eccentricity in his favourite disciple:
I am aware that you are driven by innermost inclination to the study of
the occult and I am sure you will return home richly laden . . . You will be
accused of mysticism.27
This last observation turned out to be entirely prophetic. In another letter to Freud,
dated 12 June of the same year, Jung commented further on his astrological studies,
revealing an increasing emphasis on the importance of astrology for psychology:
My evenings are taken up very largely with astrology. I make horoscopic
calculations in order to find a clue to the core of psychological truth . . . It
appears that the signs of the zodiac are character pictures, in other words
libido symbols which depict the typical qualities of the libido at a given
moment.28
In his reply, Freud declined to comment on this deepening involvement with astrology, although he may not have been quite as disinterested as he seemed. In 1896,
eleven years before he met Jung, Freud wrote a letter to his close friend and medical
colleague, Wilhelm Fliess (1858–1928), commenting on Fliess’ idiosyncratic theory
of ‘vital periodicity’: the idea that astronomical cycles influence both historical
periods and the organs of the human body.29
You know that I do not laugh at fantasies such as those about historical periods . . . There is something to these ideas; it is the symbolic presentiment of
unknown realities with which they have something in common . . . One can
no longer escape from acknowledging heavenly influences. I bow before you
an honorary astrologer.30
Whatever he might have meant by this statement, it seems that Freud was unwilling
to enter into a discussion with Jung about his own views on ‘heavenly influences’.
In 1910, a year before Jung announced his involvement with astrology, Freud had
asked Jung to help him form an ‘unshakeable bulwark’ against ‘the black tide of
mud – of occultism’.31 Jung was understandably mistrustful of what he understood
as Freud’s ‘flight from himself . . . from that other side of him which might perhaps
be called mystical’.32 The painful and acrimonious break between them came soon
after, when Jung published his literary throwing down of the gauntlet, Wandlungen
und Symbole der Libido, in 1911–12.33 As Jung himself put it: ‘The publication of the
book marks the end of our friendship’.34
As important as is Jung’s admission of the value of astrology in providing psychological insights, his second letter to Freud is also significant because of the way
in which Jung used the term ‘libido’. For him, it was not limited to the sexual
instinct, as Freud had insisted, but encompassed the raw psychic energy of life,



20 Jung’s understanding of astrology

manifesting as ‘the creative impulse’.35 This widening of the concept of libido
was clearly expressed when Wandlungen was first published and, allied with Jung’s
understanding of the cycle of the zodiac as an imaginal portrayal of the cycles of
the libido, suggests that astrology had already begun to influence his understanding
of psychological dynamics at least two years before the final break with Freud. Jung
initially described astrological imagery as ‘projection’ – the unconscious imposition
of an interior psychological content onto an external object – seemingly implying
that astrology is entirely a product of the human psyche and has no actual connection with the heavens. But his letter to Freud actually reveals a much subtler view.
The French philosopher Henri Bergson had developed a concept which he called
élan vital (‘vital force’), and Jung borrowed Bergson’s phrase, durée créatrice or ‘creative power’, as a synonym for the libido that exists everywhere and in everything.36
Within this framework, the symbols of the zodiac, while their specific imagery
might be generated by the human psyche, find a correspondence in something
inherent in reality itself, reflected in the qualities of time. ‘Time and creative power’,
Jung insisted, ‘are absolutely identical’.37 There is, in other words, a form of ‘sympathy’ or resonance between what humans experience and formulate imaginally as
the zodiacal images, and what actually belongs to life itself, unfolding its creative
potency through the particular attributes of each individual moment. While astrological symbols, as psychic projections, might have no connection with the heavens
on a physical level, the cycles of the heavens reflect temporal qualities that are ‘out
there’ as much as ‘in here’.
Jung emphasised this idea of a resonance between the human psyche and celestial cycles in one of his ‘Interpretation of Visions’ seminars, given in Zürich in 1932:
Astrology may be quite unknown to you consciously, yet to your unconscious it is very intimately known . . . The qualities of the different months
of the year, in other words, the signs of the zodiac, are really the projections
of our unconscious knowledge of time and the qualities of time. It is as if
there were profound knowledge in our unconscious, knowledge based upon
unconscious experiences, that certain things originating at certain times of
the year have such and such qualities.38
This perspective echoes Plato’s declaration that time is ‘the moving image of eternity’, and that the heavens, along with the days, nights, months, and years generated
by the cyclical motion of the heavenly bodies, ‘are all parts of time’.39 In the Visions
Seminars, Jung elaborated further on his understanding of the qualities of time as
expressed in individual zodiacal images. The time between the third week of July
and the third week of August, represented by Leo, the celestial Lion, is ‘passionate,
fiery, dangerous, and . . . exceedingly male’, and symbolises ‘the idea of power’.40
Taurus, the celestial Bull – the ‘sign of May’ – is ‘blind unconscious creative force’.41
As we shall see in Chapter 6, Jung’s understanding of the so-called Platonic Year,
the great cycle of 26,000 years that maps the movement of the vernal equinoctial
point through the zodiacal constellations, was also based on perceiving the cycle of



Jung’s understanding of astrology

the zodiac as a symbol of the qualities of time. Jung was convinced that the collective unconscious, as well as the individual psyche, reflects these constantly shifting
qualities of the libido, and that the cycles of history – particularly the formation of
new religious images – mirror the great cycles of equinoctial precession.
Jung’s first published reference to astrology appeared soon after his letter to
Freud, in an essay titled ‘The Theory of Psychoanalysis’. This essay was initially
presented as a series of lectures at the medical school of Fordham University in
New York in September 1912, when Jung and Freud crossed the Atlantic to deliver
the message of psychoanalysis to the American psychiatric establishment.42 At this
time the relationship between Jung and his mentor was already strained to breaking point.43 A German translation of Jung’s essay was published in 1913, with the
English version appearing in five issues of the American journal, The Psychoanalytic
Review, between 1913 and 1915.44 Discussing the dream of a female patient, Jung
referred to the mythic theme of death and resurrection, and declared:
This motif is found in countless myths all over the world . . . The meaning
immediately lying behind it is astro-mythological: the sun is swallowed by
the sea monster and is born again in the morning. Of course, the whole of
astro-mythology is at bottom nothing but psychology – unconscious psychology – projected into the heavens; for myths never were and never are
made consciously, they arise from man’s unconscious.45
This statement was carefully phrased to prevent misunderstandings: ‘astrology’ has
become ‘astro-mythology’, a term undoubtedly more appropriate for the medical
students at a Jesuit-run university.46 But it echoes Jung’s letter to Freud from the
previous year, in which Jung stated that the zodiac is an imaginal projection of the
human psyche onto the heavens. Jung’s statement to Freud that astrology is ‘indispensable’ to an understanding of mythology suggests that he understood ‘astromythology’ – narratives about the heavenly bodies – as the source of all myth, a
perception supported by the oldest extant cosmogonic myths of the Sumerians and
Babylonians.47 In Jung’s view, the most fundamental human experiences of birth,
youth, maturity, and death, both physical and psychological, are ‘projected’ onto the
cycles of the Sun, planets, and constellations, which rise, culminate, and set only to
rise again in an apparently eternal round.
Jung’s assumption of a mysterious, ‘sympathetic’ connection between psyche and
cosmos may already have been firmly entrenched by the time he gave his lectures
to the students at Fordham University. Robert Segal has argued that Jung was a
‘modernist’ following in the tradition of Sir James Frazer and Edward Burnett
Tylor in the late nineteenth century, because Jung promulgated a ‘clear-cut separation of the psychological from the physical and the metaphysical – the separation
of the inner from the outer’.48 But this observation is relevant only to Jung’s very
early statements, which may well have been worded to avoid conflict with Freud
and protect himself from ridicule. What is particularly interesting about the remark
Jung made at Fordham University is that he felt it necessary to make it at all. In



22 Jung’s understanding of astrology

1912, Jung, in his official capacity as a Freudian, appeared to offer a ‘scientific’
explanation of astrology at Fordham: the ubiquitous human experience of birth and
death is imagined as a solar narrative, which offers the promise of rebirth as well
as assigning meaning to a natural celestial event. This approach, as Segal suggests,
seems to echo Frazer’s Golden Bough, which presented the cyclical journey of the
Sun-god or his human surrogate, the solar hero, as an effort of the ‘primitive mind’
to explain the natural phenomenon of the rising and setting of the Sun as well as
injecting meaning into the frightening reality of the brevity of human life. Myth is
thus nothing more than bad science and an effort to escape the existential fact of
human mortality. But Jung’s statement was much subtler, and hinted at the psychological importance he had already begun to assign to the perception of meaning
in heavenly cycles. His comment to the students at Fordham foreshadowed what
emerged soon afterward in Liber Novus: the central significance of the astrological
Sun as the symbol of an inner, transpersonal Self.
Once Wandlungen was published and Jung’s repudiation of Freudian psychoanalysis was made public, references to astrology in the various papers included in
the Collected Works became more frequent. These references reflect a continuing
and deepening involvement with astrology, punctuated by various letters to colleagues and friends, that reveals Jung’s increasing reliance on astrological symbolism
as a source of insight into both his patients and himself. Despite his ongoing concern with presenting a scientific approach in his work, Jung sometimes exhibited a
mischievous sense of humour: he casually dropped astrological observations into his
essays, along with the traditional planetary and zodiacal glyphs – references which
his professional colleagues were not likely to understand and which Jung did not
bother to explain.
An example of this mischievous propensity is displayed in an essay first published in German in 1934.49 In this paper, Jung discussed a patient whom he called
‘Miss X’,50 who was ‘born in the first degrees of Cancer’.51 In a footnote to this
statement, Jung casually observed that Miss X’s horoscope ‘shows four earth signs
but no air sign’. This is not likely to mean a great deal to a reader unacquainted
with astrological terminology. To an astrologer, however, ‘four earth signs but no
air sign’ indicates that, in the birth horoscope, there are no planets placed in any
of the zodiacal signs of the airy trigon (Gemini, Libra, and/or Aquarius), but four
planets are placed in the signs of the earthy trigon (Taurus, Virgo, and/or Capricorn).52 There is, in other words, an inherent overemphasis on those characterological attributes described by the symbol of earth, and an absence of those attributes
described by the symbol of air. Following this information, for which Jung offered
no interpretation, he then laconically declared:
The danger coming from the animus is reflected in B q C.53
Apart from the bewilderment this statement is likely to arouse among the astrologically uninitiated, there are three important ideas expressed in Jung’s brief assessment



Jung’s understanding of astrology

23

of Miss X’s horoscope. The first idea relates to his formulation of the psychological
‘types’ and their relationship with the four astrological elements.

The four elements and the psychological types
First published in 1921, Psychological Types was researched between 1913 and 1918,
while Jung was steeped in the visions of Liber Novus and concurrently worked to
deepen his astrological knowledge.54 Jung’s theory of types provides models of the
individual’s general orientation to the world (extravert or introvert) and the four
‘functions of consciousness’ (thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition): modes of
adaptation through which a person perceives and evaluates reality. It is a dynamic
model in which there is constant movement, development, and change throughout
life, with integration and wholeness emerging in direct proportion to the degree
to which an individual makes an effort to become conscious of those aspects of the
personality that are inherently ‘weak’ and undeveloped.
Of all Jung’s models, his psychological typology has proven to be the most popular. It has been simplified, generalised, and adapted in numerous forms in both
cognitive psychology and various commercial milieux – a development which Jung
himself might have found highly questionable, given his deep mistrust of the ‘Spirit
of This Time’. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), first published in 1943
by Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers and based on Jung’s work, is still widely used
in vocational guidance as well as personality assessment and marital counselling,
despite numerous criticisms of its ultimate accuracy and effectiveness.55 Since 1977,
the Journal of Psychological Type has offered a steady sequence of articles on the
subject, and the Center for Applications of Psychological Type, the organisation
currently promulgating the Type Indicator, offers on its website a ‘quick and easy
to read primer on archetypes’ whose brevity and simplicity bring to mind Monty
Python’s ‘All-England Summarize Proust Competition’.56 It has also become a
commonplace in modern astrology texts to apply Jung’s theory of the four psychological function types to the astrological elements, offering interpretations of those
elements based on Jung’s descriptions.57
The astrological elements were clearly important in Jung’s assessment of his
patients’ horoscopes, as his comments about Miss X indicate. The elements are
also relevant to the characters Jung encountered in the visions he recorded in Liber
Novus, since these figures are described in terms of particular elements: The Red
One, for example, wears ‘fiery red clothes’.58 The elements, and their concomitant
Aristotelian qualities of hot or cold, moist or dry, are also an essential aspect of
the scenic backdrops or landscape settings in which the characters in Liber Novus
appear. This is the ‘composition of place’ described in Ignatius of Loyola’s Spiritual Exercises, a sixteenth-century work which was of considerable importance to
Jung.59 In Liber Novus, the Anchorite Ammonius, for example, appears in a hot, dry
desert landscape, although he himself is described as dry and cold: in Aristotelian
terms, he is an earthy figure inhabiting, and dependent on, a fiery landscape.60



24 Jung’s understanding of astrology

These kinds of element associations in Liber Novus are discussed more fully in The
Astrological World of Jung’s Liber Novus.
The late antique, medieval, and early modern astrological and alchemical texts
in Jung’s library provided him with a rich matrix of speculations on the four elements. The first extant textual evidence of the elements appears in the writings of
the philosopher Empedocles in the fifth century bce. But despite Jung’s statement
that Empedocles ‘attempted to impose order on the chaos of natural phenomena
by dividing them into the four elements’,61 Empedocles himself referred to them as
‘roots’ rather than ‘elements’. They are divinities, not substances, and they generate
the ‘forms and colours of all those mortal things’.62 Plato was the first to call them
‘elements’ (stoicheia), after the Greek word for a letter of the alphabet; ancient Greek
letters, like Hebrew, are identical with numbers, and number, for Plato, provided
the archetypal foundation of all things.63 For Jung, too, numbers were archetypal,
existing both within and outside the human psyche:
One does not know whether numbers are discovered or invented. I think
counting, i.e. making use of numbers, has been invented; numbers however
were found in us and outside ourselves. Numbers are like archetypes, which
are just as much outside as inside.64
In the second century ce, the astrologer Claudius Ptolemy, although he did not
use the term ‘element’, adopted Aristotle’s association of hot, cold, moist, and dry
in relation to the elements, which are all admixtures of those four attributes: earth
is dry and cold, fire dry and hot, water moist and cold, and air moist and hot,65
and the temperaments associated with the four astrological elements reflect these
qualities in characterological and physiological terms.66 Vettius Valens, a younger
contemporary of Ptolemy, whose work, like Ptolemy’s, was familiar to Jung,67 was
the first astrologer to assign the elements to four groups of three zodiacal signs
each, referred to as ‘triplicities’ or ‘trigons’. According to Valens, the element of fire
comprises the triplicity of Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius; earth the triplicity of Taurus,
Virgo, and Capricorn; air the triplicity of Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius; and water
the triplicity of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.68 This idea of the astrological triplicities proved to be an extremely long-lived tradition, reappearing in medieval and
early modern astrological texts, and eventually in the works of the modern astrologers who provided the materials from which Jung first learned to cast and read
horoscopes.69 In his descriptions of the function types – thinking, feeling, sensation,
and intuition70 – Jung did not explicitly assign them to the four elements of air,
water, earth, and fire, although he made clear in Psychological Types that he believed
the correlation existed:
From earliest times attempts have been made to classify individuals according
to types, and so to bring order into the chaos. The oldest attempts known to
us were made by oriental astrologers who devised the so-called trigons of the



Jung’s understanding of astrology

25

four elements – air, water, earth, and fire . . . According to this age-old view,
whoever is born in these trigons shares in their aerial or fiery nature and will
have a corresponding temperament and fate.71
Jung also referred to the theories of Claudius Galen (129–216 ce), a physician,
surgeon, and astrologer, whose four ‘temperaments’, derived from the fifth-century
bce physician Hippocrates, equated the element of air with the sanguine temperament; water with the phlegmatic; fire with the choleric; and earth with the
melancholic. Jung declared that Galen merited ‘the credit for having created a psychological classification of human beings which has endured for two thousand
years’.72 Jung’s insistence that astrology’s four elements provided the earliest form
of typology can be challenged; it has been argued that theories of temperament did
not begin with astrology, but that astrology acquired them from philosophy and
medicine.73 However, what is relevant in the context of Jung’s astrology is what he
himself believed, and it seems that he supported his theory of the ancient history
behind the four function types with the assumption that astrology provided the first
blueprint for them.
A comparison of Jung’s descriptions of the function types with descriptions of
the elements provided by contemporaneous astrological texts offers a clue to one
of the routes, and possibly the primary route, by which Jung arrived at his typology.
Alan Leo, whose work was published over a decade before Jung wrote Psychological
Types, described the element of air as ‘the higher mind’, related to ‘extension and
expansion’; the airy signs abstract the ‘essence’ from external situations and objects
and relate that essence to an ‘ideal’.74 For Jung, the thinking function is an ‘intellectual process’ that begins with the perception of objects and ‘attempts to subordinate
them to a subjective idea’.75 Leo described the element of earth as ‘the dense body
of man’, representing ‘solidity and stability’; earth is the ‘plane of action, conservation of energy, and concentrated forces’. Virgo, as one of the earthy signs, reflects the
power to ‘interpret sensations more or less correctly’.76 For Jung, the sensation function, as sense perception, is entirely dependent on the evidence of material reality:
As sensation is chiefly conditioned by the object, those objects that excite the
strongest sensations will be decisive for the individual’s psychology . . . Objects
are valued in so far as they excite sensations, and, so far as lies within the
power of sensation, they are fully accepted into consciousness whether they
are compatible with rational judgments or not. The sole criterion of their
value is the intensity of the sensation produced by their objective qualities.77
Jung’s elaboration of the astrological element of earth, included in an essay he wrote
in 1928 about the role of the Swiss in Europe, was not entirely complimentary.78
But his descriptions of the psychological types were likewise not written to flatter;
and his portrayal of the earth signs, which echoes his descriptions of the sensation
type, followed faithfully the interpretations offered by astrologers from Ptolemy



26 Jung’s understanding of astrology

to Alan Leo in terms of the character qualities associated with this ‘dry’ and ‘cold’
element.
From olden times the astrological sign for Switzerland was either Virgo or
Taurus; both are earth-signs, a sure indication that the earthy character of
the Swiss had not escaped the old astrologers. From the earth-boundness of
the Swiss come all their bad as well as their good qualities: their down-toearthness, their limited outlook, their non-spirituality, their parsimony, stolidity, stubbornness, dislike of foreigners, mistrustfulness, as well as that awful
Schwitzerdütsch and their refusal to be bothered, or to put it in political terms,
their neutrality.79
According to this model, Jung’s patient, Miss X, born with ‘four earth signs’, was
inherently inclined to relate to life through a well-adapted sensation function, focused
on the particular rather than on the general, and on the concrete level of existence
rather than on its hidden meaning or relation to broader ideas. With ‘no air sign’ –
that is, no planets placed in any of the three airy signs at birth – her thinking function, although capable of exhibiting a high degree of intelligence, was less conscious
and therefore less adapted, and consequently more vulnerable to the domination
of the critical, opinionated, and divisive inclinations of the unconscious ‘animus’,
exacerbated by that pesky Moon-Mercury configuration which Jung described
in his enigmatic footnote.80 Jung’s division of the function types into polarities –
extraverted and introverted expressions of each function – does not match Alan
Leo’s tripartite division of each element into what are known in astrology as the
quadruplicities: ‘cardinal’ (initiating), ‘fixed’ (stabilising), and ‘mutable’ (interpreting
and adapting) expressions.81 But both Leo and Jung postulated, for each of the four
personality types, a variety of modes of perception and action within a particular
sphere of experience. Both also insisted that the function type, or element, needs
to be viewed in relation to other factors in the individual personality in order to
be properly understood and, if necessary, integrated more fully into consciousness
through deliberate effort. Both men, in other words, understood their typologies to
be dynamic, flexible, and evolutionary, rather than static and immovable.

Planets and complexes
The second idea expressed in Jung’s description of Miss X’s astrological makeup
relates to his understanding that planetary configurations – the ‘planetary gods’ in
dynamic relationship to each other – symbolise unconscious complexes, which
are expressed imaginally through the mythic narratives that portray in symbolic
form the structure and teleology of the complex. The animus, according to Jung,
personifies the unconscious masculine aspect of the female psyche and, in the horoscope of Miss X, it is symbolised in part by the planet Mercury, which threatens the
instinctual female qualities of the Moon through the tension of the difficult angle
between them. This tension is in turn exacerbated by the unsophisticated quality



Jung’s understanding of astrology

27

of Miss X’s thinking function.82 Viewed in this way, an unconscious complex is not
the product of either traumatic childhood events or suppressed instinctual urges; it
is inherent and archetypal, although its expressions are coloured by both circumstances and conscious choice.
By the time Jung wrote Psychology of the Unconscious, his understanding of complexes had deviated radically from the earlier views propounded by Freud and
his predecessors.83 Freud understood complexes to be rooted in instinctual urges;
within the Freudian model, the complex (and specifically the Oedipus complex)
is the primary factor in psychic dynamics. Myth is secondary: a poetic and, at the
same time, sublimated expression of those instinctual urges that are repressed due
to social taboos. Myths can therefore be intellectually analysed and ‘reduced’ to the
bare bones of unconscious sexual conflicts.84 Thus, when Oedipus unknowingly
murders his father Laius and marries his mother Iokasta, the mythic narrative is
‘merely’ a poetic portrayal of every son’s unconscious desire to destroy his father in
order to gain sexual possession of his mother. Behind the mythic Oedpius stands
the ‘Oedipus complex’.
For Freud, like his predecessors, the complex is always pathological, because
it involves a repression of powerful instinctual urges that results in conflict and
psychic suffering. Complexes are not ‘normal’, let alone creative or suggestive of a
meaningful teleology, but must be overcome:
They [neurotics] fall ill of the same complexes against which we healthy
people struggle as well. The only difference is that healthy people know how
to overcome those complexes without any gross damage demonstrable in
practical life, whereas in nervous cases the suppression of the complexes succeeds only at the price of costly substitutive formations.85
Jung, in contrast, eventually came to understand that behind the ‘Oedipus complex’
stands Oedipus himself – not as an historical reality, but as the imaginal portrayal of
a dynamic psychic energy of which the sexual urge represents only one dimension.
Oedipus’ destruction of his father and union with his mother might, in this context,
reflect not simply a literal and forbidden incestuous desire, but a fundamental human
longing to shatter the power of the rational ego (the father) in order to merge with,
and be transformed by, the depths of the unconscious (the mother) – an interior process which forms the primary theme of Liber Novus.86 Complexes, as Jung first developed the idea in 1912 in Psychology of the Unconscious, are the psychic expressions of the
libido, which is not limited solely to forbidden Oedipal wishes. Complexes embody
fundamental life processes, psychic and spiritual as well as instinctual, and are not
merely products of the repression of the sexual instinct. Their compulsive and often
destructive power arises, not from their innate malignancy, but from what Jung perceived as the failure of the individual to recognise and integrate their deeper teleology:
For if he allows his libido to get stuck in a childish milieu, and does not free
it for higher purposes, he falls under the spell of unconscious compulsion.



28 Jung’s understanding of astrology

Wherever he may be, the unconscious will then recreate the infantile milieu
by projecting his complexes, thus reproducing all over again, and in defiance
of his vital interests, the same dependence and lack of freedom which formerly
characterized his relations with his parents. His destiny no longer lies in his
own hands: his Tucai kai Moirai (fortunes and fates) fall from the stars.87
For Jung, the myth came first. As he suggested at Fordham University in 1912, myths
emerge from projections of fundamental psychic patterns onto the heavens, which
provide an excellent ‘hook’ because they mirror back the same patterns through the
qualities of time. These patterns are ‘just as much outside as inside’. The Sun rises
from an unknown darkness each morning, and sinks back into the darkness in the
evening; the human being emerges out of an unknown darkness at birth and returns
to that unknown darkness at death, with the hope that, like the Sun, some immortal
fragment will survive death and be reborn in some form, some time, somewhere.
The myth thus embodies the complex in imaginal form. Complex and myth
are the same: the former is experienced as psychic compulsion and the latter as
a psychic image that can itself facilitate consciousness and the transformation of
the compulsion. The individual expression of the complex, in turn, follows specific
channels shaped by a unique succession of personal experiences and the responses
to those experiences; but the responses themselves are rooted in inherent temperament. Typology and complex are therefore intimately related. Jung believed that
collectives also have complexes, and so do religions; so, too, do the cycles of history.
Everything possessing life and dynamism is thus ‘fated’ by the nature of its complexes,
which are inherent patterns perceived by the human psyche as mythic narratives that
determine both character and fate. Studies of demonic possession, the phenomenon
of multiple personalities, mediumistic trances, shamanic rituals, exorcism, hypnotic
healing trances, automatic writing, and visions in the crystal all contributed to Jung’s
increasing appreciation of the contents of the unconscious complex as mythic and
transpersonal rather than personal and pathological.88 And for Jung, the archetypes
that lie at the core of every complex are symbolised by the planetary gods:
The journey through the planetary houses . . . therefore signifies the overcoming of a psychic obstacle, or of an autonomous complex, suitably represented by a planetary god or demon.89

Transformation and individuation
The third idea implicit in Jung’s discussion of the horoscope of Miss X is the possibility of transformation. Complexes, like planetary fate, are negotiable, in their level
of expression if not in their essence. Had Jung not believed that change was possible, he would not have accepted Miss X as a patient, nor referred to ‘danger’ from
the animus rather than an irrevocable fate. ‘Danger’ suggests that something can
be mitigated or avoided, provided there is sufficient knowledge and insight; Jung’s
brief comment on Mercury in a quadrate aspect to the Moon is not described as



Jung’s understanding of astrology

29

a preordained event, but as a psychological dynamic amenable to conscious intervention. The idea of a developmental process initiated by the unconscious psyche
itself – the transformation of instinct into ‘higher purposes’ through the power of
symbols – provides the core theme of Wandlungen, and echoes a seminal statement
made by Iamblichus in the third century ce: it is the gods themselves, of their own
volition and through their own symbols, who take charge in the theurgic ritual
and accomplish the transformation of the individual soul.90 This idea is intimately
linked with Jung’s concept of ‘individuation’, which he defined as the inner process through which an individual can achieve full integration of his or her unique,
inherent personality:
Individuation means becoming an ‘in-dividual’, and, in so far as ‘individuality’
embraces our innermost, last, and incomparable uniqueness, it also implies
becoming one’s own self. We could therefore translate individuation as ‘coming to selfhood’ or ‘self-realization’.91
But this process cannot be achieved solely through the power of the conscious will;
it depends on the cooperation of the unconscious or, in Iamblichus’ terms, the gods
themselves.
Jung associated individuation with a degree of psychological freedom, once
again comparing the unfoldment of the process with the myth of the soul’s journey
through the planetary spheres:
The journey through the planetary houses boils down to becoming conscious of the good and the bad qualities in our character, and the apotheosis
means no more than maximum consciousness, which amounts to maximal
freedom of the will.92
‘Maximal’ freedom, it should be noted, is not the same as complete freedom. Commenting on the planetary journey of the soul as it was described in a late fifteenthcentury romance by Francesco Colonna titled Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, Jung noted
that the author created a psychological document that is ‘a perfect example of the
course and the symbolism of the individuation process’.93 It seems, from Jung’s
equation of the soul’s celestial journey with the individuation process, that he
understood the natal horoscope not only as a psychological map of character and
complexes, but as a meaningful narrative or, in effect, a personal mythic journey.
This journey unfolds over time through a sequence of life experiences connected
by meaning through a central organising principle understood as the Self, and
moves toward the experience of a whole personality and a meaningful life.
In Jung’s view, while this process occurs naturally in all human beings and is
initiated by the unconscious psyche itself, techniques of analytic work such as active
imagination deepen and enhance the process,94 making it possible for an individual
such as Miss X to work with the ‘danger coming from the animus’ in a conscious and more creative way. Jung never suggested that Miss X could replace her



30 Jung’s understanding of astrology

horoscope with a different one. But he seems to have developed the conviction that
the relationship between consciousness and the archetypal realm needed to become
a dialogue, not a monologue, and that participating in the dialogue with the appropriate receptivity could affect both the individual and the mysterious archetypal
patterns that constitute individual fate.

Astrology and alchemy
In the years following the completion of Liber Novus, Jung’s statements about astrology became more frequent in his correspondence, his lectures, and his published
works. While he continued to formulate his astrological experience through terms
such as ‘synchronicity’, which he hoped would be acceptable to a scientific community, he also deepened his understanding of astrology’s relationship with other
liminal spheres, particularly alchemy, whose symbolism likewise provided him with
a model of the individuation process. Jung insisted that astrology and alchemy had
always been intertwined:
The alchemical figures, especially the gods of the metals, should always be
thought of astrologically as well . . . The alchemical symbols are saturated
with astrology.95
In another essay, he suggested, writing as an astrologer, that a knowledge of mythology and alchemy are both necessary for a psychological interpretation of astrological significators:
Alchemy is inconceivable without the influence of her elder sister astrology,
and the statements of these three disciplines [mythology, alchemy, astrology]
must be taken into account in any psychological evaluation of the luminaries
[Sun and Moon].96
This intimate relationship is based on the idea that astrology and alchemy, and the
myths accompanying them, present the process of individuation in symbolic form.
Astrology, like alchemy, is ‘ceaselessly engaged in preserving the bridge to . . . the
unconscious psyche’; astrology ‘led the conscious mind back again and again to the
knowledge of Heimarmene, that is, the dependence of character and destiny on
certain moments in time’.97 The melding of alchemical symbolism with that of its
‘elder sister’, astrology, led Jung to perceive a striking parallel between the stages
of the alchemical opus, the Gnostic, Neoplatonic, and Hermetic portrayals of the
journey of the soul through the planetary spheres, and the circuitous path by which
the individual psyche achieves integration and wholeness.
Astrologically . . . this process [alchemy] corresponds to an ascent through
the planets from the dark, cold, distant Saturn to the sun . . . The ascent
through the planetary spheres therefore meant something like a shedding of



Jung’s understanding of astrology

31

the characterological qualities indicated by the horoscope . . . Anyone who
has passed through all the spheres is free from compulsion; he has won the
crown of victory and become like a god.98
In later years, Jung maintained his insistence that astrology could be of immense
value to psychology. In a letter to the Indian astrologer Bangalore Venkata Raman,
written in 1947, he stated:99
As I am a psychologist I’m chiefly interested in the particular light the horoscope sheds on certain complications in the character. In cases of difficult
psychological diagnosis I usually get a horoscope in order to have a further
point of view from an entirely different angle. I must say that I very often
found that the astrological data elucidated certain points which I otherwise
would have been unable to understand. From such experiences I formed the
opinion that astrology is of particular interest to the psychologist.100
The planetary gods, according to Jung, are symbols of the archetypal dominants of
the collective unconscious, present in every human psyche but, according to the
specific moment of birth, appearing in the individual as a unique pattern of interrelationships representing ‘a definite moment in the colloquy of the gods, that is to
say the psychic archetypes’. Jung suggested to André Barbault that these patterns
are ‘expressed in a recognizable way in the horoscope’ but are likewise present in
life itself.101 The idea that astrology is merely a human projection onto an inanimate sky – Frazer’s understanding of myth as bad science – had, for Jung, long been
superseded, if he had ever thought of it that way in the first place.

13 Analytic training groups vary in their attitudes toward Jung’s astrology. The C.G. Jung
Institute in Zürich has held courses in astrology for many decades, and in recent years
the Association of Jungian Analysts in London has offered seminars on astrology and
synchronicity. The Society of Analytical Psychology in London, in contrast, has never
included astrology as part of its curriculum.

18 Jung’s correspondence with Fordham was congenial. Fordham was helpful in suggesting
that Liliane Frey, who collaborated with Jung on the ‘astrological experiment’, might
write a brief foreword outlining the astrological traditions behind the experiment
(Michael S. Fordham, letter to C.G. Jung, 20 October 1954). He also reassured Jung that,
although he could not ‘speak with any semblance of authority on this difficult topic’,
he knew what a horoscope was (Michael S. Fordham, Letter to C.G. Jung, 10 January 1955). This is confirmed by a natal horoscope drawn for Fordham in the German
style in an unknown hand, accompanied by a typed analysis using both technical astrological language and Jungian terms such as ‘anima-possession’ (Wellcome Library PP/
FOR/A.4). This horoscope bears neither date nor signature. It was not drawn by Jung;
Fordham probably requested it from a Swiss or German astrologer but chose not to
mention it to Jung.

‘cryptomnesia’, insisting that Bergson had unconsciously derived his idea of durée créatrice
from the Neoplatonist Plotinus; see Jung, Visions Seminars, Vol. 2, p. 325. The idea is
more likely to have come from Bergson’s Hasidic background; see Ben-Ami Scharfstein,

JUNG’S ASTROLOGERS

But, if the stars announce the future . . . what explanation of the cause have we
to offer? . . . We may think of the stars as letters perpetually being inscribed on
the heavens or inscribed once for all and yet moving as they pursue the other
tasks allotted to them; upon these main tasks will follow the quality of signifying . . . All teems with symbol; the wise man is the man who in any one thing
can read another.1
—Plotinus

In the symbol there is the release of the bound human force struggling with
darkness . . . One can certainly gain outer freedom through powerful actions, but
one creates inner freedom only through the symbol. The symbol is the word that
goes out of the mouth, that one does not simply speak, but that rises out of the
depths of the self as a word of power and great need and places itself unexpectedly on the tongue.2
—C.G. Jung

Jung’s astrological sources
The astrological sources Jung cited for public consumption in the Collected Works
are those that the passing centuries have transformed into historical artefacts. These
include such works as Ptolemy’s second-century Tetrabiblos, Abu Ma’shar’s ninthcentury De magnis coniunctionibus, published in Latin in 1515, and Jerome Cardan’s
seventeenth-century Commentaria in Ptolomaeum de astrorum indiciis.3 Jung avoided
citing any living astrological practitioners when referring to the subject in his published works, except those authors involved in statistical research. While the older
texts clearly provided him with important insights, it is unlikely that Jung actually
learned how to cast a horoscope from them; not only is the language obscure, but



38 Jung’s astrologers

the mathematical calculations, when they are described, depend on actual observation and measurement of the heavens rather than on the ease of the published tables
of planetary positions, known as ephemerides, available in Jung’s own time. It seems
that Jung’s discomfort about revealing the extent and sources of his astrological
investigations pursued him throughout his life.
In the essay, ‘Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle’,4 Jung displayed
considerable technical astrological knowledge. He freely referred to twentieth-­
century explorers into psychic phenomena, such as J.B. Rhine,5 and he acknowledged the statistical results of astrological experiments made in the 1920s and 1930s
by researchers such as the Swiss astrologer Karl Ernst Krafft and the French astrologer Paul Flambart.6 But he cited for his horoscope interpretations only the ‘big
names’ in ancient, medieval, and early modern astrology, along with various alchemical texts and the works of those reputable philosophers – Philo of Alexandria, Plotinus, Schopenhauer – who indicated sympathy toward the subject.7 It is unclear from
Jung’s early letters to Freud whether he was ‘looking into’ astrology – or, to be more
precise, learning to cast and interpret horoscopes – through texts he had acquired, or
whether he had a private tutor. According to Jung’s grandson, Ulrich Hoerni, Jung
‘got his knowledge from books rather than from any personal teacher’.8
Richard Noll claims that ‘it is thought’ Toni Wolff taught Jung astrology, but
precisely who ‘thought’ it is not mentioned; and, in any event, Jung’s astrological
studies predated his meeting with Wolff by at least two years.9 Jung mentioned no
sources to Freud, although in later life he enjoyed a lively correspondence with professional astrologers such as Barbault and Raman. But although the Collected Works
include only astrological sources rendered worthy of scholarship by a respectable
historical interval, Jung’s private collection of modern astrology books tells another
story. While he accumulated individual works published from the mid-1920s
onward by German, French, British, and American astrologers, the only books in
Jung’s library that had been published shortly before his two letters to Freud, and
which were likely modern sources for his early studies, are those by three British
astrologers. Of these three, only one was of sufficient interest for Jung to acquire
more than one of the author’s works.
The first of these British texts, a work titled The Text-Book of Astrology by Alfred
John Pearce (1840–1923), was originally published in 1889 as a series of volumes
dealing with diverse astrological themes, including the reading of the birth horoscope, the interpretation of national charts and political events, astro-meteorology,
medical astrology, and ‘electional’ astrology (choosing the appropriate moment
to begin a venture). These smaller works appeared in a combined single volume
in 1911, the edition that Jung acquired. James Holden, Research Director of the
American Federation of Astrologers, which issued a reprint of Pearce’s work in
2006, points out that Pearce’s book is ‘traditional’ and ‘devoid of the psychological
trend set in motion by his [Pearce’s] younger contemporary Alan Leo’. With a bias
reflecting his own personal views in terms of what constitutes valid astrology – a
debate that has been ongoing within the world of astrological practitioners for over
two millennia – Holden further states that The Text-Book of Astrology ‘precedes the



Jung’s astrologers 39

complications introduced by esotericism . . . and vague psychological interpretations’.10 Pearce was deeply antagonistic to any astrology that trailed esoteric clouds
behind it, declaring categorically: ‘We draw the line at magic and spiritualism’. Alan
Leo’s Theosophical astrology, according to Pearce, is ‘superstitious nonsense’.11
But if Pearce was not interested in esotericism and ‘vague psychological interpretations’, it seems that Jung was not interested in Pearce. Although Pearce wrote
numerous other astrological works, The Text-Book of Astrology is the only publication by this British astrologer to be found in Jung’s library.12 Nor does Jung seem
to have been attracted to the journals that Pearce edited,13 although he acquired
a sizeable collection of other esoteric journals that included astrological material,
such as Ralph Shirley’s The Occult Review and Mead’s own journal, The Quest.14 It
would appear that the ‘psychological trend’ emerging in British astrology at the
turn of the twentieth century was more rewarding to Jung during the time he was
first formulating his theories about the nature and dynamics of the human psyche.
The second work Jung acquired by a British astrologer writing during this
period was Raphael’s The Key to Astrology.15 It was the fashion of the time for astrologers to adopt celestial pseudonyms, usually those of angels associated with specific
planets. A series of astrologers editing a particular journal might use the same pseudonym in sequence, which was the case with Raphael. The angel Raphael, one of
the seven archangels, is usually linked with Mercury, the planet in astrological lore
most concerned with writing and the communication of ideas and thus appropriate
for the editor of a journal.16 Raphael was initially the pseudonym for an astrologer
called Robert Cross Smith (1795–1832). Smith’s pseudonym was then adopted by
the astrologer John Palmer (1807–37) and by four subsequent astrologers before
Robert Thomas Cross (1850–1923), author of The Key to Astrology, took up the
name.17 The Key to Astrology was originally published in 1896, although it later
ran through a number of reprints. Jung’s particular edition appeared in 1909. Like
Pearce, Raphael was both traditional and prolific, publishing other volumes such
as Raphael’s Horary Astrology (1897). Also like Pearce, Raphael edited an almanac,
predictably titled Raphael’s Almanac. As with Pearce, it seems that, having read one
work by this author, Jung was not sufficiently impressed to acquire more.

Alan Leo’s ‘modern’ astrology
The third British astrologer whose work was published around the time Jung began
his studies seems to have held a far higher position in Jung’s estimation than Pearce
and Raphael. Alan Leo, born William Frederick Allan (1860–1917), was a unique
figure in the esoteric world of fin-de-siècle Britain because, virtually single-handed,
he brought astrology into the modern era as a tool for insight into character rather
than a method of prediction.18 Leo displayed no erudition in any sphere of clinical psychology or classical scholarship, relying almost entirely on the works of his
mentor, H.P. Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophical Society. According to Leo’s
wife Bessie, who produced a hagiography of her husband two years after his death,
Leo studied no astrological works other than those of Raphael, and relied solely on



40 Jung’s astrologers

FIGURE 2.1 Alan Leo

Blavatsky’s foundation texts of Theosophy, Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine, to
acquire his spiritual knowledge.19 In a section of her biography titled ‘Alan Leo’s
Faith’, Bessie Leo cited the cosmological and religious perceptions on which her
husband’s understanding of astrology was based:
I believe that the Principle which gives life dwells in us and without us comes
from the Supreme Intelligence through the Rays of the Sun . . . I believe the
Soul of Humanity is immortal or perpetual; and I am convinced that each
individual soul or mind is symbolised by the Moon in its ebb and flow . . . also
by its relation to the Planetary Spheres of Influence . . . Every man derives his
will power from a Planetary Sphere of Influence which he uses, or abuses, by
which he can overcome evil tendencies and control his animal nature, hence
Astrology teaches that Character is Destiny.20



Jung’s astrologers 41

Alan Leo joined the Theosophical Society in 1890, when he became involved
with G.R.S. Mead, then secretary of the Society, in the creation of a Theosophical
lodge in Brixton. Bessie’s biography of her husband is a treasure-trove of anecdotal
information about the emergence of an early form of psychological astrology at the
turn of the century that has many echoes in Jung’s own work. Most important of
these echoes is the central significance of the Sun in the horoscope, which was one
of Leo’s great innovations in modern astrology. He derived the idea from Blavatsky’s
quasi-Neoplatonic teachings about the invisible ‘spiritual’ Sun or Solar Logos as
the embodiment of divinity,21 and it is recognisable in Jung’s identification of this
noetic solar potency as the focus of the inner journey of Liber Novus.22
Jung acquired early editions of a number of Leo’s texts, some of which were
initially published as articles in Leo’s own journal, Modern Astrology. These articles subsequently appeared as individual pamphlets, and were then compiled and
reissued within a few years as revised single volumes. Leo’s strong influence on
Jung’s astrological imagery in Liber Novus is discussed more fully in the appropriate
chapters in The Astrological World of Jung’s Liber Novus. But Jung’s editions of Leo’s
books tell an interesting story in themselves. Jung was very careful with his books;
he neither dog-eared the pages nor defaced them with ink. Particular sections of
certain favoured books are lightly marked in pencil with vertical lines in the margins indicating a significant paragraph, or the occasional underlining of a phrase or
reference. Sometimes he wrote a few words in pencil in the margin of a work that
particularly interested him, or a question mark if he queried an author’s opinion.
Alan Leo’s Astrology for All was originally published in two volumes in 1899.23 The
first volume discusses natal chart interpretation through the combination of Sun
and Moon signs. The second volume comprises mathematical tables and detailed
instructions for calculating a horoscope. A second edition of both volumes was
published in 1904; it is this edition that Jung obtained. As a third, revised edition
appeared in 1908 and a fourth in 1912, it is likely that Jung acquired his own copy
before its third edition, suggesting that he began his exploration of astrology much
earlier than the date indicated by his letter to Freud.
Jung had also begun accumulating the technical apparatus of astrology, such as
ephemerides – published tables of planetary positions – five years earlier than his
letter to Freud. As these planetary tables were produced each year, an ephemeris
for 1906 would only be useful for that year,24 although it is possible that Jung
acquired his 1906 ephemeris at a later date in order to calculate the horoscope
of his daughter Gret, who was born in that year.25 Jung’s copy of Astrology for All,
Part II is heavily annotated; here one can see specific dates which Jung underlined with coloured pencils, and a series of mathematical calculations in pencil in
the margins. It seems that Jung was learning the mechanics of setting up a birth
horoscope from the instructions given in Leo’s book.26 This evidence, and an
unmistakable similarity between the two men in their phrasing and ideas about
particular astrological configurations, suggest that Jung was reading, and learning
from, a succession of Leo’s publications throughout the period he worked on
Liber Novus.

Another and far more striking indication that Jung relied on Alan Leo’s astrological interpretations is provided by a document titled ‘The Key to Your Own Nativity: Special Chart’, which Jung received from the Dutch psychoanalyst Dr. Johan
van Ophuijsen in 1911 – the year that he informed Freud that he was ‘looking into’
astrology. Van Ophuijsen (1882–1950), whose signature is on the document, was a
disciple of Freud, and had spent time in Zürich as Jung’s patient between 1911 and
1913, while Jung was still nominally part of the psychoanalytic côterie.28 Van Ophuijsen became co-founder of the Dutch Psychoanalytical Society in 1917. He was one
of several psychoanalysts who attempted to resolve the growing conflict between
Freud and Jung, and was present at a meeting between the two men in Munich in
November 1912, organised to discuss the escalation of their antipathy and architect some kind of reconciliation. After Freud and Jung parted ways, van Ophuijsen
remained a staunch Freudian. However, his involvement with astrology suggests that
Freud’s lack of response to Jung’s interest in the subject was either not shared by his
followers, or did not reflect Freud’s real views at the time. The ‘Special Chart’ provides no name and simply states ‘for male’ (in English), but lists all of Jung’s planetary
placements at the time of his birth. It was intended, as its title indicates, to be supplemented by specific paragraphs in Leo’s The Key to Your Own Nativity, published

beginning of Leo’s book, with the planetary placements inserted for King George
V as an illustration. Each planetary position in the ‘Special Chart’ is assigned a paragraph number that correlates with the appropriate descriptive passage in Leo’s book.



44 Jung’s astrologers

The pre-printed blank form on which Jung’s astrological information was written is from Leo’s Modern Astrology Office in London, suggesting that van Ophuijsen was either officially working as a tutor for Leo’s school, or had obtained a
form from the school. Although he may have had copies made of the blank form
included at the end of The Key to Your Own Nativity,30 the document in Jung’s private archives is not a copy but an individual printed form, neither mimeographed
nor torn from a book. Van Ophuijsen’s handwritten notes are in English. It is
impossible to know from the ‘Special Chart’ itself whether the two men discussed
it in any depth, although, given van Ophuijsen’s presence in Zürich for two years
as Jung’s colleague and patient, it would be surprising if they had not. The chart
states explicitly that Saturn in Jung’s horoscope is the ‘ruling planet’, and refers to
the paragraph in Leo’s book in which Saturn is described as giving ‘a disposition
that is sober, serious, and thoughtful’ and confers the gift of ‘the meditative mind’.31
As we will see later, this Saturnine rulership of Jung’s horoscope was profoundly
important to him and is particularly relevant to certain figures in Liber Novus.
In the lower right corner of the ‘Special Chart’ is a section titled ‘Future Prospects’, in which van Ophuijsen inserted the movements of Jung’s planets after birth
for the years 1911, 1912, and 1913.32 The ‘Special Chart’ was evidently prepared
in 1911, just at the time that Jung announced his astrological studies to Freud, and
it provides one of the earliest documentary indications of an important source of
Jung’s astrological research at the time. It also suggests that, the ‘black tide of occultism’ notwithstanding, Jung’s introduction to Alan Leo was encouraged, if not actually initiated, by one of Freud’s colleagues. It seems that, in 1911, Jung was not alone
among his fellow psychoanalysts in the pursuit of ‘wretched subjects’.
The ‘Future Prospects’ section of the ‘Special Chart’, which covers the precise
period of Jung’s break with Freud, the publication of Psychology of the Unconscious,
and the beginning of work on Liber Novus, also suggests that Jung may have been
seeking astrological insights to help with the growing tensions between himself
and Freud. In 1911, Jung was not merely ‘looking into’ astrology; he was assiduously reading and learning from Alan Leo’s books and had received – probably at
his own request – a horoscope calculated by a psychoanalyst familiar with Leo’s
school and linked with the interpretative material Leo had provided in his published text. It seems likely that most, if not all, of Jung’s early forays into astrology
were strongly coloured by the distinctive psycho-spiritual perspective offered by
Leo’s extensive works.

Max Heindel’s ‘Rosicrucian’ astrology
In 1909, a Danish esotericist named Carl Louis von Grasshoff (1865–1919), who
later called himself Max Heindel, founded a school in Seattle, Washington, which
he described as ‘The Rosicrucian Fellowship: An Association of Christian Mystics’. The mission of Heindel’s school was to prepare the public for the approaching Aquarian Age through promulgating the ‘true philosophy’ of the Rosicrucians.
This ‘true philosophy’ was related to a legendary historical fellowship purportedly
founded in 1313 by a Christian mystic called Christian Rosenkreutz. Like the



Jung’s astrologers 45

FIGURE 2.4 Max Heindel

foundation narrative of Freemasonry, the foundation narrative of the Rosicrucians,
whose existence was first proclaimed in the early seventeenth century through
a series of published pamphlets known as the ‘Rosicrucian Manifestos’,34 is difficult if not impossible to confirm through historical evidence, as is the existence
of any historical personage called Christian Rosenkreutz. Nevertheless, since the
seventeenth century, various groups and currents linked with both early modern
alchemy and Freemasonry have proclaimed themselves as ‘Rosicrucian’,35 and a
long sequence of works by self-proclaimed members of the ‘Order’ has continued
into the present day. That Jung was deeply interested in the Rosicrucians is suggested by the large number of references found in the Collected Works,36 and also by
his familiarity with, and respect for, the works of A.E. Waite (1857–1942), a former
Theosophist and member of the Order of the Golden Dawn as well as a historian of
Rosicrucian, alchemical, and Grail lore, who in 1915 established his own ‘Rosicrucian’ group called the Fellowship of the Rosy Cross.37
In 1911, Max Heindel established a permanent home for his Rosicrucian
organisation at Oceanside, California, where it still exists today and, even in these
postmodern, multicultural times, still refers to itself as ‘An Association of Christian Mystics’.38 Heindel was strongly influenced by the work of the German esotericist Rudolph Steiner (1861–1925), who had himself originally been schooled



46 Jung’s astrologers

in Blavatsky’s Theosophical Society before he broke away because of Blavatsky’s
exclusively Eastern orientation. Steiner subsequently founded his own school,
known as Anthroposophy,39 and Jung, not surprisingly, was as familiar with this particular German esoteric current as he was with British Theosophy, and was equally
critical of both. Steiner’s Anthroposophical Society, like Blavatsky’s Theosophical
Society, was, in Jung’s view, a movement ‘of a genuinely religious character’, but
it masqueraded as ‘spiritual science’ and, despite Steiner’s efforts, failed to develop
into an organised church.40 Something similar has, of course, been said about Jung:
that his analytical psychology is ‘of a genuinely religious character’ but masquerades
as scientific psychology.41 Jung’s criticisms of Steiner notwithstanding, although
Jung found Anthroposophy, like Theosophy, unattractive in its official dogmas and
organisational structure, it seems that Steiner’s ideas, many of which were inspired
by Goethe and were particularly amenable to being embedded in an astrologicalpsychological context, were not so easily repudiated.42
Like Blavatsky, Max Heindel believed he had received communications from
highly evolved disincarnate spiritual entities. He called his spiritual guides the Elder
Brothers, and it is these communications that formed the basis of the Fellowship’s
doctrines. Heindel was a prolific teacher and writer; his most important books were
The Rosicrucian Cosmo-conception, a work similar in genre to Blavatsky’s The Secret
Doctrine, and The Message of the Stars, one of several works he produced on astrology
and its applications to both healing and what he understood as spiritual growth.43
None of Heindel’s books appears in the catalogue of Jung’s private library. But it
seems that Jung was more interested in Heindel than this absence of published
works might suggest.44 Even if Jung never actually purchased any of Heindel’s
works, he actively took up a course of astrological study with Heindel’s Rosicrucian
Fellowship in the mid-1920s, drawing on this ‘Rosicrucian’ material, not only for
an understanding of his own horoscope, but, as discussed more fully in Chapter 5,
for certain themes in his interpretation of the Astrological Ages or Aions.
Heindel’s organisation, then as now, offered correspondence courses in both
‘Rosicrucian Philosophy’ and astrology; Jung apparently enrolled in the latter. It
is unclear for how long he pursued this course, as the materials in the archives are
not dated and many appear to be missing; he might only have tried a few lessons
and abandoned the effort, or he might have completed the course. The former is
more likely, as Jung had little patience with dogmatic teachings filled with religious
certainty, and Heindel was nothing if not dogmatically certain. The course was
advertised as a study programme that taught ‘the importance of astrology as a phase
of religion and a Divine Science’, and, following Heindel’s particular understanding
of astrology as spiritual knowledge rather than divination, it was open to ‘anyone
not engaged in fortune telling or similar methods of commercializing spiritual
knowledge’.45 The material in Jung’s archives consists of several pages, and begins
with a cover diagram displaying a general but comprehensive astrological scheme,
including the traditional zodiacal signs divided into their triplicities (elements),
quadruplicities (‘cardinal’, ‘fixed’, and ‘mutable’), decans (divisions of each sign into
ten-degree segments), and ruling planets, as well as the spheres of life covered by
each of the twelve sectors or ‘houses’ of the horoscope.

Beneath the diagram is a paragraph headed ‘Notice to Students’; the diagram, an
original printed document and not a mimeograph, is an introduction intended for
neophytes who had just enrolled in the correspondence course.
This chart is designed to give you a bird’s eye view of the whole subject
of Astrology . . . It should be used as a means of correlating the information which you gradually obtain from our correspondence course and books.
A careful study of it will repay you . . . If you have any questions about it,
we would suggest that as far as possible you wait until you are able to obtain
answers from your study of the correspondence course and the text books
recommended . . . As you progress in the study of the subject, you will constantly add new keywords to your previous list.
Following this cover page is a personal ‘Horoscope Data Sheet’, with the name of
the student left blank but cast for Jung’s birth date, place, and time. The handwriting is not Jung’s, and it is probable that this information was filled in by one of the
tutors running the course. That the writing is by an American astrologer is indicated by the manner in which the dates are written, with the month given first and
then the day. A list of transiting planets is given for various dates in 1928. A second
Horoscope Data Sheet, in the same handwriting, once again presents Jung’s natal
chart (with the name left blank), but with the progressed planetary positions listed
for 1926, 1927, and 1928. A third Horoscope Data Sheet displays the progressed
planetary positions for 1929. Finally, a fourth Horoscope Data Sheet presents a list
of both natal and transiting planets for 1931. All these lists of horoscopic data are
drawn in the same hand on standard pre-printed blank forms with the Rosicrucian
Fellowship logo at the top. It is impossible to know from the existing documents
whether Jung requested all these charts at the same time or over a period of several
years, as the papers are not dated. It is during this same period – the mid- to late
1920s – that Jung engaged in a lengthy correspondence with a British astrologer called John Thorburn, discussed more fully below, and requested a natal chart
interpretation from him. It was also during this period that Jung completed his
calligraphic transcription of Liber Novus.
It is possible that Jung enlisted a friend already involved with Heindel’s organisation to produce these horoscopes for him. There are a number of charts in
Jung’s private archives that were prepared for his colleagues and patients – including
Freud, Toni Wolff, and Eugen Bleuler (1857–1939), who was Jung’s mentor at the
Burghölzli Clinic from 1900 to 1909 – by individuals other than himself. Some
were drawn by Emma Jung, who seems to have been as involved with astrology as
was Jung himself; some are drawn by persons unknown.48 A few were prepared by
Jung himself, such as the one shown below in Fig. 2.7 for an unknown individual,
and a calculation sheet which Jung prepared for his daughter Helene, born in 1914.
However, if the Rosicrucian charts were prepared by someone other than a tutor
from the Fellowship, it is difficult to understand why the general cover sheet for
students was included in the materials. Moreover, even if Jung was not enrolled in



Jung’s astrologers 49

FIGURE 2.6 The Rosicrucian Fellowship ‘Horoscope Data Sheet’, set for Jung’s birth

year, date, time, and place47

the course, his choice of astrologer to provide the materials is, in itself, revealing: he
chose an American who followed an astrology with an esoteric or spiritual overview, echoing Jung’s interest in the Theosophically inclined astrologer Alan Leo.
Although Jung was no more a card-carrying Rosicrucian than he was a Theosophist, it seems he found Heindel’s approach to astrology more congenial than the
predictive applications available at the time in both English and German, because



50 Jung’s astrologers

FIGURE 2.7 Horoscope drawn by Jung for an unknown individual, born 12 August 189149

Heindel promulgated a process of dynamic inner transformation that could be
understood psychologically as well as spiritually. Like Leo, Heindel incorporated
the idea of reincarnation into his understanding of the natal horoscope:
It should never be forgotten, however, that our horoscope shows what we
have made of ourselves in past lives, and he who has the configuration that
attracts friends must have been kind and obliging, while he who draws out
the mean side of human nature and makes enemies is himself selfish and
unfriendly. But if he will strive to turn away from his ways and make some
sacrifice for others, he will also in time overcome the undesirable aspects, for
the Star Angels are not maliciously bent upon scourging anyone.51
In its extreme moral simplicity and certitude, this could hardly be construed as a
‘psychological’ understanding of the natal horoscope. But Heindel’s astrology was
concerned with a conscious effort to transform habitual character propensities, and
in this sense it was more adaptable to Jung’s psychological approach than a simple
description of personality traits or a prognosis of preordained future events.

Myths and astrological symbols
There are other elements in Heindel’s work that merit closer scrutiny in relation
to Jung’s understanding of astrological configurations. The use of mythic narratives
in the interpretation of astrological symbols is a hallmark of Heindel’s approach,
and it closely resembles Jung’s concept of ‘amplification’: the use of mythic stories
and images to elucidate the deeper meanings and associations of a symbol. Heindel
was an avowed Christian and would not have considered stories about the life of



52 Jung’s astrologers

Jesus as myth, and the mythic narratives he described were usually bound up with
the grand cosmological drama of human evolution presented in Blavatsky’s Isis
Unveiled. Nevertheless, some of the imagery Heindel utilised – which was often less
Christian than he might have been willing to recognise – echoes the manner in
which Jung also drew on mythic motifs to breathe life and teleology into otherwise
static characterological descriptions of the zodiacal signs.
In The Message of the Stars, for example, Heindel introduced Mercury through
the planet’s mythic role as ‘Messenger of the Gods’, whose ‘wisdom-teaching is
symbolically represented by the caduceus or “staff of Mercury”’; he then explained
the symbolism of the serpents around the caduceus as the Theosophical ‘spiral path’
of the ‘involution’ of the soul into matter.52 Heindel’s interpretation of the zodiacal sign of Virgo offers another example: unlike other astrological texts that focus
on the sign’s earthy, fastidious nature (as did Jung himself in his description of the
Swiss), Heindel emphasised the symbolism of the ‘celestial virgin’ as the mother of
the inner messiah waiting to be born.
Before the Aquarian age is definitely ushered in, we will, in all probability,
have made great strides, both in overcoming the lust of the flesh and the
lust after the flesh. For Virgo, the immaculate celestial virgin, and the ears
of wheat contained in the sign, show both these ideals as profitable to soul
growth at the present time . . . By looking to the mother ideal of Virgo during the Piscean Age, and following the Christ’s example of sacrificial service,
the immaculate conception becomes an actual experience to each of us, and
Christ, the Son of Man, Aquarius, is born within us.53
While Aquarius, for Heindel, is the ‘Son of Man’, offering the possibility of the realised spark of divinity within, Virgo is ‘the vehicle of the immaculate conception’:
Yearly, at the winter solstice, the immaculate Madonna is ascendant at midnight, when the newborn Sun commences to rise to the task of growing the
grain and grape . . . The Sun is therefore an apt symbol of the Savior, born to
feed his flock on the spiritual bread of life.54
The equation of Mary with the ‘celestial virgin’, and Christ with the new-born
Sun entering Capricorn at the winter solstice, was not Heindel’s invention. Christ’s
solar attributes are observable in the iconography of the early Church, chiefly in the
nimbate figure of the saviour with solar rays around his head, and in the choice of
the winter solstice, which marked the annual rebirth of pagan solar deities such as
Mithras and Sol Invictus, for the birth of the Christian messiah. It is hardly a new
observation that the early Church appropriated a number of motifs from pagan
religious iconography in order to make its own message more ‘marketable’.55
Heindel seems to have availed himself of literature from the late nineteenth century regarding the intimate relationship between solar myths, religion, and celestial phenomena. As a practising astrologer, he then applied mythic images to the



Jung’s astrologers 53

interpretation of individual horoscopes. The influential Orientalist scholar Friedrich Max Müller (1823–1900) gave the theme of universal solar worship scholarly
respectability in 1873 with his reiteration of the already well-established claim that
there had once been an original, pure religion focused on the Sun:
This source of light and life, this silent traveller, this majestic ruler, this departing friend or dying hero, in his daily or yearly course.56
Müller’s influence extended not only to Blavatsky and Heindel but also to Jung,
who acquired Müller’s Theosophy: Or, Psychological Religion as well as a German
translation of Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religions.57 The scholarly trend
toward seeing a primal, universal solar religion behind figures such as Christ and
Mithras permeates Jung’s work during the period he worked on Liber Novus. In
Psychology of the Unconscious, references to the Sun as the central symbolic motif of
the individuation process dominate the work, as well as providing one of the core
themes of Liber Novus. If the new-born Sun at the winter solstice is equated with
the messiah, the ‘celestial virgin’, Virgo, would necessarily be equated with Mary as
the mother of the messiah. Max Heindel was not the originator of the use of myth
to provide a deeper meaning for the zodiacal signs; but he was perhaps the most
important astrological author, contemporary with and familiar to Jung, who appropriated the idea of the Sun as a Christ-symbol and Virgo as the ‘Celestial Mother’
and used it in his astrological interpretations.
Jung, like Heindel, drew on older ideas about the mythic associations of the constellations, adapting them to his understanding of the zodiacal signs and incorporating them in his interpretation of birth chart significators. It is useful to compare
Heindel’s description of Virgo given above with Jung’s own mythically inclined
interpretation of this zodiacal sign. According to Jung,
The mother-goddess – and the star-crowned woman of the Apocalypse
counts as one – is usually thought of as a virgin . . . Virgo, the zodiacal
sign, carries either a wheat-sheaf or a child . . . At any rate, this woman has
something to do with the prophecy of the birth of the Messiah at the end of
time . . . Its [Salvator mundi, saviour of the world] mother is the Sapientia Dei
[Sophia, wisdom of God] or Mercurius as Virgo.58
Virgo is thus not only a Mercury-ruled earthy sign whose ‘parsimony, stolidity, and
stubbornness’ seemed discernible to Jung in the Swiss character. This zodiacal sign
also carried a deeper significance for him: it symbolised that aspect of the libido
that conceives and brings to birth the inner solar ‘saviour’ or Self. In psychological
terms, Virgo spoke to Jung of mediumship and the hidden wisdom of the archetypal realm – a perception that emerges in the figure of Salome in Liber Novus, and
was perhaps not uninfluenced by the fact that Toni Wolff, who acted as Jung’s
psychic guide and midwife throughout the period he worked on Liber Novus, was
born with the Sun in Virgo.59



54 Jung’s astrologers

In another example, the zodiacal sign of Cancer, as Jung described it in 1934,
‘signifies resurrection because the crab sheds its shell’, and, as a ‘feminine and watery
sign’ belonging to the realm of the Mother, is related to the ambiguous crablike creature called Karkinos, sent by Hera to bite the hero Herakles in the heel during his
fight with the Lernaean Hydra.60 This use of mythic themes in relation to a specific
individual’s horoscope – in the case of Cancer, the horoscope of his patient, Miss X,
who was ‘born under’ this zodiacal sign61 – may have been partly inspired by Max
Heindel’s approach to astrology. Whatever the source, myth seems to have provided
Jung with a sense that the horoscope at birth can describe not only the nature of the
individual’s inherent temperament and unconscious complexes, but, more importantly, the deeper teleology of the individual’s psychic life: the path of individuation.
It is the unique manner in which Jung understood myth, and the ways in which he
applied it to amplify astrological signatures and vice versa, that allowed him to weave
horoscopic themes into his understanding of the individuation process.

John Thorburn and the ‘epoch’ charts
In 1928, when Jung was nearing the completion of his calligraphic transcription
of Liber Novus and was also exploring the astrology of Max Heindel’s Rosicrucian
Fellowship, he and his wife Emma both engaged in a correspondence with John
MacCaig Thorburn (1883–1970), a Scottish astrologer and university lecturer in
philosophy who had settled in the west of England. At Jung’s request, Thorburn
sent him, on 19 August 1928, a lengthy written interpretation of Jung’s natal horoscope. Thorburn was then teaching at University College, Cardiff, but he had spent
some time with Jung in Zürich prior to their correspondence, in the capacity of
a patient as well as a friend. In a letter to Emma Jung, dated 15 February 1929,
Thorburn mentioned how deeply he missed David and Cary Baynes,62 and stated
that his psychotherapeutic work with a certain ‘Mrs. Schwill’ in England gave him
‘the feeling of keeping a little bit in touch with Zürich at a time when it seems
impossible to visit it any more’.
Thorburn was an early admirer of Jung’s work, and produced, within three years
of the English publication of Jung’s Psychology of the Unconscious, several scholarly
papers, as well as one book, that favoured Jung’s analytical psychology over Freud’s
psychoanalytic theories. These works were written several years before the date
when Thorburn produced his interpretation of Jung’s horoscope.63 Thorburn’s Art
and the Unconscious, published in 1925, presents an unabashed criticism of Freudian
theory in comparison with what Thorburn viewed as the inarguable importance of
Jung’s unique understanding of religious symbolism and the role of the imagination
in creative work.64 Thorburn was one of the original members of the Analytical
Psychology Club of London,65 and remained a member for many years, giving a
paper to the Club in 1958 titled ‘Do the Gods Exist?’, which was later published
in the Jungian journal Harvest.66 He was also active in British astrological circles,
and was a participant at the first formal British astrological conference, given at
Harrogate in April 1939, at which a number of astrologers (although not all), in



Jung’s astrologers 55

common with many of their European counterparts, issued misguidedly optimistic
predictions that there would be no European war.67 Although Thorburn had been
Jung’s patient, he was also a friend, and it seems he spent a considerable amount of
his time in Zürich discussing astrology with Jung. This astrology was in part characterological, but it was not the kind of predictive analysis described in so many texts
available at the time. It was a quasi-psychological, quasi-Theosophical astrology,
focused primarily on the teleology of the individuation process.
Thorburn’s analysis of Jung’s natal chart is, at first glance, a fairly conventional
character study. The chart was drawn on the distinctive pre-printed horoscope
form first designed by Alan Leo.69 However conventionally characterological some
of Thorburn’s statements might have been, his analysis also included some pointedly psychological references, such as the interpretation of particular planetary
configurations as ‘complexes’. For example, Thorburn referred to Jung’s Sun in
Leo in a quadrate (90°) angle to Neptune in Taurus as ‘a “mystical” complex’
which is ‘the direct astrological equivalent of your mysticism and of your mystical

FIGURE 2.9 John M. Thorburn’s drawing of Jung’s natal chart, included in a letter dated

19 August 192868



56 Jung’s astrologers

FIGURE 2.10 Alan Leo’s birth chart, drawn on his personally designed pre-printed hor-

oscope form70

orientation to nature’.71 The equation of a planetary configuration with a complex is undoubtedly derived from Jung’s own thinking on the subject, especially
as Thorburn’s assessment of this ‘complex’ did not carry any pathological implications. This reference in Thorburn’s analysis is important in demonstrating how
Jung’s ideas about complexes related them to the relationships between the planets
in the horoscope.
In one of his published papers, Thorburn declared Freud’s psychoanalysis to
be based on the function of ‘sensation’, in contrast to Jung, whose psychology
was based on ‘intuition’, the opposite function.72 In Psychological Types, Jung had
asserted that individuals invariably perceive life through the bias of their own temperament; complete objectivity is an illusion, and the creation of any psychological
‘system’ is inevitably based on the psychologist’s own individual psychology.73
One sees what one can best see oneself. Thus, first and foremost, one sees the
mote in one’s brother’s eye. No doubt the mote is there, but the beam sits in
one’s own eye – and may considerably hamper the act of seeing.74



Jung’s astrologers 57

Although Jung did not mention either his own or Freud’s ‘function type’ in Psychological Types, he explicitly declared his typology in a letter to the German astrologer Oskar Schmitz, written in 1923: Jung considered himself ‘a thinking intuitive
introvert’.75 Given the fact that the visions of Liber Novus were pervading his life at
the time he was researching the text of Psychological Types, that work, without the
need for specific personal revelations, also suggests how Jung understood his own
temperament:
Had this type [introverted intuition] not existed, there would have been no
prophets in Israel . . . Introverted intuition apprehends the images arising from
the a priori inherited foundations of the unconscious.76
Jung did not make specific equations between astrological elements and function
types in his published work. But as an astrologer, he would have been fully aware of
the fact that Freud was born under Taurus, an earthy sign (which Thorburn related
to the function of sensation), while Jung himself was born under Leo, a fiery sign
(which Thorburn related to intuition). Additionally, Jung’s Ascendant, and that allimportant chart ruler, Saturn, are both placed in the element of air (which Jung
seems to have related to thinking). According to the logic of Jung’s references to the
balance or imbalance of elements in the chart of his patient, Miss X, the emphasis
on air and fire in Jung’s chart seems to fit with precision his assessment of his own
typology as biased toward thinking and intuition. Thorburn’s remarks on Freud’s
and Jung’s respective typologies reflect an astrological perspective on the nature of
the conflict between the two men – a collision between a world perceived through
sensation and a world perceived through intuition – which Thorburn must have
discussed with Jung himself. Thorburn’s remarks thus highlight the importance of
astrology in the development of Jung’s typological model.
One of the most notable observations in Thorburn’s interpretation of Jung’s
natal horoscope is his emphasis on the great importance of the planet Saturn. Thorburn’s analysis opened with the bald statement: ‘Saturn rises in Aquarius’. He went
on to elaborate:
We have here a strong, dignified and powerfully aspected Saturn without
affliction. Now this is rather remarkable and, so far as my experience goes,
very unusual . . . It must surely be a tremendous asset that ‘the greater malefic’
should be thus free and favoured in the natus . . . The trine77 of Jupiter and
Saturn in these signs [Libra and Aquarius respectively] is very strong evidence
of life-work steadily pursued on behalf of mankind and in an unquestionable
ethical and religious orientation.78
Thorburn’s description echoes with uncanny accuracy the role that Philemon, the
most important imaginal figure in Liber Novus, played throughout Jung’s psychic
life. The paradox of a planet known as the ‘greater malefic’, serving as a positive
and creative guide of the soul’s ‘life-work’, seems to reflect the ambiguity of Jung’s



58 Jung’s astrologers

archetypal ‘wise old man’ in Liber Novus. Philemon’s relationship with the astrological Saturn is discussed in greater detail in The Astrological World of Jung’s Liber
Novus. Here it is sufficient to note that Jung took very seriously the idea that he
was ‘ruled’ by Saturn. In a letter he wrote to the American author Upton Sinclair
in 1955, Jung declared:
The ruler of my birth, old Saturnus, slowed down my maturation process to
such an extent that I became aware of my own ideas only at the beginning of
the second half of life, i.e. exactly with 36 years.79
Jung was thirty-six years old in 1911, the year in which he informed Freud he was studying astrology and made public his disagreement with his mentor’s theories through
the publication of Wandlungen, the German version of Psychology of the Unconscious.

Thorburn’s ‘epoch’ charts
Along with the interpretation of Jung’s natal chart, Thorburn included a detailed
interpretation of a chart which he titled ‘Epoch’.

In Britain during the 1920s and 1930s, an astrological technique known as the
‘Prenatal Epoch’ came into fashion. It was based on an ancient theory known as
the ‘Trutine of Hermes’, attributed to Hermes Trismegistus and mentioned in the
second century ce by Vettius Valens in his Anthologiarum Libri and by Ptolemy in
his Tetrabiblos.81 The technique was fully developed in the Arab world in the tenth
century, refined further in the medieval to early modern periods, and resurrected
in the astrology of the early twentieth century.82 The Prenatal Epoch is an effort to
determine and interpret the horoscope for the moment of conception,83 and was
utilised by astrologers as a means of ‘rectifying’ or correcting a horoscope when the
birth time was vague or inaccurate (a common problem in England, as the birth
time is not usually recorded except in the case of twins). The Prenatal Epoch was
also deemed to be useful as a means of investigating the possible causes for birth
defects of various kinds. The technique is still in use today in some astrological
circles, and computer software is available that will calculate it.84
A more esoteric interpretation of the Prenatal Epoch emerged in 1925, when
the British Theosophical astrologer Walter Gorn Old (1864–1929), who wrote
under the angelic pseudonym of Sepharial, published a work that transformed the
technique into a means of determining the purpose of the soul’s incarnation. Sepharial’s underlying idea, in accord with Theosophical doctrines, was based on the
belief that many successive lifetimes are required before the soul reaches its full spiritual potential. Sepharial proposed that the natal horoscope reflected the physical
circumstances of a particular life; the Epoch chart, in contrast, indicated the ‘astral’
inheritance or soul-level of that life. The spiritual purpose of a given incarnation
could be discerned in a hybrid of the Prenatal Epoch chart that Sepharial called the
Solar Epoch.85 Sepharial’s book on the subject emphasised the spiritual nature of
the Sun – a theme close to the heart of any Theosophical astrologer – in contrast to
the biological nature of the Moon. Sepharial’s work was quickly followed by other
texts emphasising the spiritual potential of various forms of Epoch horoscopes.86 In
1931, the astrologer A.E. Thierens (1875–1941) openly declared his allegiance to
Madame Blavatsky and her seminal work, The Secret Doctrine, and called Sepharial’s
Solar Epoch chart a map of ‘the solar nature of Man’s being’.87
Various technical permutations of Sepharial’s Solar Epoch produced a plethora
of interpretative innovations. The Epoch chart that John Thorburn sent to Jung
is one of these innovations. It was calculated for the moment the Sun was in the
precise position it had occupied at the time and place of Jung’s birth, but exactly
one solar revolution earlier, in July 1874, when the other heavenly bodies were in
positions entirely different from those in Jung’s natal chart.88 Drawing on the Theosophical idea of the Sun as a symbol of the divine spark in the incarnate human
being, Thorburn’s interpretation of Jung’s Epoch chart was concerned with the
‘spiritual purpose’ of Jung’s life. Thorburn referred to a theme that appears repeatedly in Liber Novus: the nature of magic.
Hence we might regard this as the horoscope of a magician . . . These [configurations] stress philosophic reflection, religion, and, generally, spiritual
masterfulness – a spirituality which also dominates within as well as without.

Regeneration . . . might, therefore, be a better general characterisation than
magic.89
Thorburn also identified the nature of Jung’s ‘life problem’ in Jung’s own language –
the ‘relation of unconscious to conscious’ – and then declared that the configurations of the Epoch chart made Jung ‘a prophet, a teacher, appropriating ideas from
an elemental source or applying them through an elemental medium’.90 This is not
a simple character analysis, but a declaration of how Thorburn understood astrology as a psychological and spiritual tool, able to highlight the essential challenges
and ultimate purpose of Jung’s life and work.
Thorburn placed great value on his Epoch chart as a key to the goal of individuation. He also produced an Epoch chart for Emma Jung, who, apparently impressed
by the interpretation of her husband’s chart, requested it from Thorburn herself.91
Although the Epoch chart was undoubtedly a topic of conversation between Thorburn and Jung during their various meetings in Zürich, no other charts of this
kind appear in Jung’s private archives; it seems that Jung did not attempt to work
with the technique himself. Nevertheless, Thorburn was able to provide the kind
of astrology in which Jung was most interested: an astrology of the psyche and the
soul, amenable to interpretation through psychological models, and reflecting a
teleology and pattern of inner development – ‘individuation’ – that could be facilitated and enhanced through analytic work.

Jung’s influence on astrology
Jung acquired numerous interpretations of his own horoscope from other astrologers. Although the zodiacal and planetary placements were always the same in
each of these versions of his natal chart (with the exception of Thorburn’s Epoch
chart), it seems that Jung sought a variety of approaches, as well as information on
the planetary movements at specific times in his life. The natal chart provided by
John Thorburn was accompanied by a written analysis. So was another horoscope,
prepared for Jung by the Zürich-born analytical psychologist Liliane Frey-Rohn
(1901–1991). Frey-Rohn’s material consists of a detailed list of planetary movements from Jung’s birth to 1945,92 including brief interpretations of the important
configurations for each successive year. Frey-Rohn was an accomplished astrologer
as well as an analytical psychologist, and acted as Jung’s assistant in the astrological
‘experiment’ that formed the basis for Jung’s essays on synchronicity.93 In an interview with the clinical psychologist Gene F. Nameche, Frey-Rohn stated that when
she first met Jung, he advised her to do astrological research with schizophrenics at
the Burghölzli Clinic. ‘Later’, she told Nameche, ‘he gave dates of birth and would
want to know if this person can become schizophrenic or not’.94
The material Frey-Rohn sent to Jung was accompanied by an undated letter
but, as she included a horoscope displaying the progressed planetary placements for
1939–40 and refers in her letter to Jung’s request for information on these years, it
is likely that the material was prepared in 1939, at the time of the outbreak of the
Second World War.95

Other versions of Jung’s horoscope were apparently discussed with him in person, as no written analyses accompany the horoscopes in the archives. One of
these horoscopes was, like Thorburn’s, drawn on Alan Leo’s distinctive pre-printed
horoscope form. It includes both Jung’s natal horoscope and the planetary positions for 1926, two years before Thorburn sent his own interpretation to Jung.



62 Jung’s astrologers

Accompanying this chart are several pages consisting of a ‘keyword’ analysis of the
main configurations in Jung’s birth horoscope, as well as lengthier paragraphs on
the four chief astrological significators: Sun, Moon, Ascendant, and Jung’s planetary ruler, ‘Old Saturnus’. A further page lists important planetary movements
in ­1928–30 – the same period in which Jung was receiving materials from the
Rosicrucian Fellowship and was corresponding with Thorburn. The individual
who compiled this material signed it ‘M.C. Bond’. That he or she was an American is identifiable, not only from the manner in which the dates are written, but
also because Bond included his/her own horoscope along with Jung’s. Although
no birthplace is given, the longitude and latitude indicate that Bond was born in
Washington, D.C. This individual, who was eight years older than Jung, may have
been Jung’s patient. But Bond was also a competent astrologer who utilised the
horoscope forms associated, once again, with Alan Leo’s Theosophical astrology.
Jung was evidently deeply concerned with the direction his life was taking in the
late 1920s, as he approached the end of his work on Liber Novus. But the nature of
this concern is unclear. He was travelling extensively during the mid-1920s, visiting
East Africa and the Pueblo Indians in North America. In 1929 he published his commentary on Richard Wilhelm’s translation of the Chinese I Ching, titled The Secret of
the Golden Flower, although it was several years later that he realised the full importance of alchemical symbolism as a symbolic mapping of the individuation process.98
Thorburn provided analyses only of Jung’s natal and Epoch horoscopes, with no
information about later planetary movements. Jung might have wanted insight into
some personal dilemma through an interpretation of the prevailing astrological factors. He may also have noticed some approaching configuration of importance and
wanted to understand its meaning. In viewing the planetary movements in his chart
during this period, he might have observed, for example, a transit of the planet Saturn
over the ‘midheaven’ or Medium Coeli of the natal horoscope in the late autumn of
1926. Alan Leo described this transit as bringing ‘failure, scandal, trouble with superiors and loss of honour and credit’ unless the individual was ‘cultured and refined’,
in which case the transit signified ‘the undertaking of great responsibilities’.99 It is
possible that Jung hoped to avoid the former and pursue the latter.
The influence of astrology on Jung’s thinking was penetrating and profound, as
was his own influence on modern astrologies. Despite determined efforts by more
‘traditional’ astrologers who, like Alfred Pearce at the end of the nineteenth century,
oppose the marriage of astrology and psychology, Jung’s impact on astrology shows
no sign of abating.100 This influence began, not during his later years, or during the
1970s when ‘New Age’ ideas were in full flower, but during the period in which
Jung worked on Liber Novus. Jung’s efforts to convince his fellow psychologists
that astrology could provide an important tool for psychology, and that psychology
could enrich astrology, were immediately successful in certain circles. Heinz Arthur
Strauss, an astrologer and historian of astrology, and his wife Sigrid Strauss-Klöbe, a
psychotherapist, worked within a uniquely German astrological current known as
Kosmobiologie, which developed in the late 1920s and early 1930s and espoused the
idea that cosmic energies influence biological processes on earth.101 Kosmobiologie

FIGURE 2.13 Natal chart for Jung by M.C. Bond, with progressed planetary placements

was one of the first fields of astrology to emphasise the importance of research
findings from a variety of scientific disciplines, with a particular focus on medical
astrology. From 1927 to 1928, Strauss edited a journal called Jahrbuch für kosmobiologische Forschung, which contained papers on medical astrology and its rationale.
Jung acquired both volumes of this journal.102
At this point, the influence seemed to be flowing one way. Jung, at the same
time he was receiving astrological interpretations from John Thorburn, M.C. Bond,



64 Jung’s astrologers

and the Rosicrucian Fellowship, was reading the work of Strauss and Strauss-Klöbe
to deepen his own understanding of astrology. But the direction of the influence
quickly changed. Strauss and his wife were both involved in the publication of
Wilhelm’s The Secret of the Golden Flower. In Jung’s memorial address for Wilhelm,
given in 1930, he stated that the I Ching, the subject of Wilhelm’s book, was ‘not
only analogous to astrology, but essentially related to it’.103 At the second Eranos
conference, held in Ascona in 1934, Sigrid Strauss-Klöbe, who had clearly been
reading Jung’s writings in the interim, delivered a paper titled ‘The Psychological
Significance of the Symbol in Astrology’.104 Jung, who had also delivered a paper
at the conference,105 responded to Strauss-Klöbe’s presentation by declaring that
she was ‘the first person to think deeply about the astrological symbols in terms of
psychology’106 – perhaps a reflection, not only of Strauss-Klöbe’s insights, but also of
Jung’s low estimation of many of the astrological texts available to him at the time.
Strauss-Klöbe was already familiar with psychoanalytic theories, but in 1935, a year
after the Eranos conference, she decided to work with Jung as his patient.107 Her
astrological publications in subsequent years increasingly incorporated Jung’s theories of types, complexes, myths, and archetypes.108 Deeply influenced by Jung’s ideas
for the remainder of her life, in 1982 Strauss-Klöbe contributed a short essay titled
‘Memory of C.G. Jung’ in the memorial volume, C.G. Jung, Emma Jung, and Toni
Wolff.109 Strauss-Klöbe and her husband are examples of a trend in German astrology that directly owed to Jung its focus on the psychological rather than the literal.
Another German astrologer, Oskar Adolf Hermann Schmitz (1873–1931),110
considered himself Jung’s pupil by virtue of his attendance at some seminars Jung
gave in Zürich in 1925.111 Although Schmitz was a great admirer of Jung’s theory
of psychological types and was active in disseminating Jung’s ideas through his own
publications,112 Jung had little sympathy with the views propounded by the esoteric
group with which Schmitz was involved. Jung compared it with Theosophy, which
was itself a ‘danger’ because
A new house is being erected on the old, unsatisfactory foundations and new
wine poured in old bottles . . . Man must after all first be changed from the
inside.113
According to Ellic Howe (1910–91), a British historian of twentieth-century
occultism, a diversity of astrologies began to emerge in Germany during the interwar years, including those influenced by Blavatsky’s Theosophy, Steiner’s Anthroposophy, and various magical groups allied with these movements. The Germans,
according to Howe, were ‘the first to discuss the idea of what they called “psychological astrology.”’114 Howe does not mention Strauss-Klöbe, nor the importance
of the Eranos conferences in the development of this marriage of psychology and
astrology. He does discuss Schmitz, whom he calls ‘the enthusiastic disciple of C. G.
Jung’, but suggests that Schmitz’ influence was minimal in the astrological community.115 However, Howe overlooks not only Jung’s pervasive influence on German
astrologers such as Strauss-Klöbe, whose books were reprinted in numerous editions, but also the indirect influence on many currents of esoteric thought exercised



Jung’s astrologers 65

internationally by the Eranos conferences and their speakers and attendees, virtually
all of whom were sympathetic, to a greater or lesser extent, to Jung’s theories on the
archetypes and the psychological types.

Symbols and doctrines
Despite Jung’s distaste for the doctrinal nature of Theosophy, the unexpectedly
fruitful three-way union of Theosophical ideas with analytical psychology and
astrology bred a number of interesting hybrids during the 1920s and 1930s. Virtually none of these hybrids enjoyed Jung’s approval. He strongly opposed any
effort to exteriorise the archetypal realm, insisting that the interpretations offered
by Theosophy and Anthroposophy were problematic because they objectified the
archetypes rather than recognising them as inner processes.
I would never want my conception of the unconscious to be even remotely
associated with parapsychology, for then the unconscious would take on a
concretized form, making impossible the psychological approach that is so
necessary for us . . . We must continue for quite a long time to stick to the
territory of critical psychology if we want to avoid the danger of conjuring
up a new Theosophy. One cannot be too careful to guard against the temptation to regard the manifestations of mysticism and parapsychology from the
outside . . . The whole thrust of analytical psychology is to open up the territory from inside, that is from within the soul.116
Jung’s understanding of the zodiacal images as imaginal projections by the human
unconscious, generated through an intuitive understanding of the qualities of cyclical time, reflects his insistence on an interior approach to astrological symbols. The
planetary ‘gods’ are found within, and can only be dealt with on a psychological
level by the individual. This approach is not found in the discussions by astrologers
such as Schmitz, although it is evident in Strauss-Klöbe’s work and, despite the
thick overlay of Theosophical language, can be discerned in a nascent form – perhaps unintentionally – in the works of Alan Leo.
The boundaries between ‘spiritual’ and ‘psychological’ realms, both of them
liminal, are full of hidden doorways, unknown tunnels, and secret windows, as
Jung himself was well aware. The terms themselves are a modern imposition of
constructed categories that would have meant nothing to Iamblichus, Plotinus,
Agrippa, or Paracelsus. Psuche is the Greek word for ‘soul’, and logos the word for
‘speech’; and the term ‘psychology’, considered in the context of its etymological
roots, bears little resemblance to some of the perspectives now offered in the academy. But Jung was not merely being self-protective in trying to avoid the label of
‘mysticism’ that Freud had prophesied he would end up having to carry. He seems
to have felt deeply that any astrological insight had to be understood as a psychological dynamic, without attempts to exteriorise and concretise its symbols. In this
he agreed with Plotinus, who embraced the idea of cosmic ‘sympathies’ but understood them as a web of symbols linked through meaning, rather than a network



66 Jung’s astrologers

of ‘influences’ or, as the Theosophist Alice A. Bailey insisted, ‘rays’ emanating from
deified planetary beings.117
Alice Bailey’s approach, and the astrological currents that sprang from her teachings, achieved precisely what Jung had tried to forestall at Eranos: they incorporated his ideas into an astrology wedded to an exteriorised religious cosmology,
rather than presenting astrology psychologically, as an interior process. In America,
the highly influential French-born astrologer Dane Rudhyar (1895–1985), whose
work remains enduringly popular in many astrological circles, trained in Alice Bailey’s Arcane School, an offshoot of the Theosophical Society. Rudhyar encountered
Jung’s work during the 1930s.118 He began mentioning Jung in The Astrology of
Personality, first published in 1936 by Bailey’s own press, the Lucis Trust. In this
early work, Rudhyar used terms such as ‘The Synchronistic Principle’, and devoted
an entire chapter to ‘Astrology and Analytical Psychology’, quoting freely from a
number of Jung’s Collected Works.
However, Rudhyar then went on to speak of a ‘spiritual psychology’, related to
but fundamentally different from analytical psychology, that ‘considers man to be
essentially and in reality a spiritual being using a body for the purpose of acquiring
concrete experiences and certain faculties which can be generated only in contact
with matter’.119 In this ‘Jungianist’ underpinning of a cosmology that assumes the
ontological independence of higher spiritual powers governing a spiritually evolving universe, Rudhyar demonstrated his allegiance to his Theosophical roots.120
Jung was aware of Rudhyar, and acquired The Astrology of Personality in its original edition, as well as one of Rudhyar’s early works on music.121 But Jung never
mentioned this well-known astrologer in his published works or letters, nor did
he purchase any of Rudhyar’s later books; nor is there any evidence of any correspondence between them. Despite Rudhyar’s importance in American astrological
circles, Jung may have viewed Rudhyar, as he viewed Schmitz, as too concretely
doctrinal in his pronouncements, despite the fact that many of Rudhyar’s ideas
about the teleology of the birth horoscope were inspired by Jung’s own concept of
individuation.
Jung’s prophecy that astrology would be ‘assured recognition by psychology’ may
seem doomed to failure. Many psychologists, particularly in the clinical sphere, are
far more reluctant to acknowledge astrology than astrologers are to acknowledge
psychology. But in the currents of depth and transpersonal psychologies, astrology,
as Jung perceived it, has been found to be useful and enlightening.122 The crossfertilisation between Jung’s astrology and Jung’s astrologers – and between Jung’s
astrology and the various depth and transpersonal psychologies that have emerged
from his work – is proving to be a rich and enduring one.

44 Books, as I was assured by Andreas Jung, tend to ‘walk’ from private libraries after the
death of their owner, due to the claims of family members and friends; many of Jung’s
astrological texts found their way into the library of his daughter Gret (1906–95), who
was herself a practicing astrologer. As Jung did not usually write his name in his books,
it is impossible to ascertain which works in Gret’s astrological library might have initially
belonged to him.

associated with death and rebirth; at this time, the last few degrees of Virgo are rising in
the east.

69 Leo was deceased by the time Thorburn drew up Jung’s chart, but his printed horoscope
forms remained available. Many astrology schools at the time tended to use their own
unique printed horoscope forms. Leo’s forms always displayed a diagram of the globe at
the centre, with the horizon and meridian axes of the horoscope marked with a double
line. Examples of this distinctive wheel can be found in Leo, The Art of Synthesis, pp. 228,

Hellenistic and/or Arabic techniques, which reflect specific traditions within astrology.
For a contemporary text on this approach, see Benjamin Dykes, Traditional Astrology
for Today (St. Paul, MN: Cazimi Press, 2011). Jung, however, relied on the traditions of
late antique Neoplatonic and Hermetic works that emphasised the interior, symbolic
astrology in which he was interested. There are a number of ‘traditions’ within astrology,
all apparently valid to those who pursue them.

the work of the astrologer Reinhold Ebertin (1901–88), sometimes considered the
founder of the school. However, Strauss was using the concept more than a decade
earlier than Ebertin, and the term itself can be dated to 1914.

ACTIVE IMAGINATION
AND THEURGY

Of the works of theurgy performed on any given occasion, some have a cause
that is secret and superior to all rational explanation, others are like symbols
consecrated from all eternity to the higher beings, others preserve some other
image, even as nature in its generative role imprints (upon things) visible shapes
from invisible reason-principles.1
—Iamblichus

The Professor: ‘Nowadays, the imitation of Christ leads to the madhouse’.
Jung: ‘That is hardly to be doubted, professor’.
The Professor: ‘The man has wit – he is obviously somewhat maniacally aroused.
Do you hear voices?’
Jung: ‘You bet! Today it was a huge throng of Anabaptists that swarmed through
the kitchen’.
The Professor: ‘Now, there we have it. Are the voices following you?’
Jung: ‘Oh no, Heaven forbid, I summoned them’.2
—C.G. Jung

The origins of active imagination
Liber Novus, and the Black Books that gave rise to it, are the first documented evidence of Jung’s use of a psychological technique he later called ‘active imagination’. He had developed the technique no later than 1913, when work on Liber
Novus began; Liber Novus is, in fact, the first fruit of it. Jung published his early
thoughts on active imagination in 1916,3 and again in 1921,4 but he did not use the
term itself until a series of lectures he gave at the Tavistock Clinic in London in
1935.5 Initially he referred to it as the ‘transcendent function’, and then the ‘picture
method’; he also described it as ‘active fantasy’, ‘trancing’, ‘visioning’, ‘exercises’,
and, perhaps most revealing, ‘technique of the descent’.6 Joan Chodorow, in the



74 Active imagination and theurgy

introduction to her edited selection of Jung’s discussions on active imagination,
points out that it is ‘a single method, but it is expressed through many different
forms’.7 The method involves a specific type of meditation: deep concentration
on, and emotional engagement with, images that have arisen in dreams, reveries,
emotional eruptions, waking fantasies, or deliberately invoked altered states of consciousness. The imagination is understood as a kind of gateway or threshold into
ordinarily inaccessible psychic realms, and as a means of giving shape to otherwise
inchoate psychic realities.
In 1916, Jung described the entry point for active imagination as a turbulent
emotional state:
He must make the emotional state the basis or starting point of the procedure. He must make himself as conscious as possible of the mood he is in,
sinking himself in it without reserve and noting down on paper all the fantasies and other associations that come up. Fantasy must be allowed the freest
possible play, yet not in such a manner that it leaves the orbit of its object,
namely the [emotional] affect.8
This description, written three years after Jung’s break from Freud, is sometimes
viewed as Jung’s version of the psychoanalytic technique of ‘free association’, which
Freud first described in 1893.9 But Jung carefully distinguished between the two,
describing active imagination as ‘a sequence of fantasies produced by deliberate
concentration’:
It is not a question of the ‘free association’ recommended by Freud for the
purpose of dream analysis, but of elaborating the fantasy by observing the
further fantasy material that adds itself to the fragment in a natural manner.10
The purpose of active imagination is thus not to provide material for an intellectual analysis of repressed conflicts, but rather, to allow that which is hidden and
unknown to express itself in its own language – the language of images. Active
imagination may also be seen as a form of ritual, akin to the focused states of
religious contemplation found in the kavvanah or ‘directed attention’ of the Jewish Kabbalah, in certain forms of Sufi meditation, in Ignatius Loyola’s ‘spiritual
exercises’, and in Neoplatonic theurgy. These older approaches to an encounter
with deity involve a deliberate suspension of the rational critical faculties in order
to allow a specific image, colour, or sound to reveal its hidden life in its own way.11
It is this kinship with religious practices, often those of marginalised or ‘heretical’
religious currents, that, in some circles, has given active imagination an esoteric
connotation. And despite Jung’s numerous elaborations, ambiguity continues to
surround the sources that might have inspired the technique.
A number of recent works have described active imagination in practical therapeutic terms, and are intended to provide insights for the psychotherapist. But such
investigations are, understandably, not concerned with the details of Jung’s historical



Active imagination and theurgy

75

sources.12 Marie-Louise von Franz (1915–98), one of the best-known of Jung’s
students and interpreters, distinguished between the various forms of Eastern meditation, which are aimed at ignoring the flow of images in meditative practice, and
Jungian active imagination: ‘In contrast to all Eastern techniques we welcome this
image and do not dispel or ignore it’.13 But von Franz’ essay does not explore the
origins of this apparently peculiarly Western favouring of the image in inner work.
Jeffrey Raff, in a book titled Jung and the Alchemical Imagination, states emphatically
that Jung’s analytical psychology is a ‘spiritual process’ aimed at ‘promoting profound transformational experience’.14 While many who have undergone Jungian
analysis might wholeheartedly agree with this comment, there is, as ever, a problem
of definition. What does Raff mean by a ‘spiritual’ process in contrast to a ‘psychological’ one, and in what context should we understand a ‘transformational experience’? Is it spiritual, psychological, physiological, or perhaps all three? Raff points
out that, as Jung consistently referred to older esoteric traditions such as alchemy
and Gnosticism, his psychological models are clearly connected with ‘earlier esoteric schools’. Although this observation has been made by other authors as well, it
is not developed in Raff ’s discussion. Raff is, in the context of his book, more concerned with the practical applications of active imagination than in examining just
what the doctrines of these ‘older esoteric schools’ entailed, how they differed from
each other, which of their ideas Jung adapted, and in what ways he utilised them.15
Active imagination bears an affinity with mediumistic trance-states.16 Jung’s
interest in spiritualism, which led to his doctoral dissertation, On the Psychology and
Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena,17 supports the likelihood that his observations of the altered state of the trance medium contributed to the development of
his ideas about the importance of the imagination in psychological work. Jung’s
explorations into spiritualist phenomena did not abate after he had completed his
dissertation, and he was still attending seances in 1931, well after the completion of
the text of Liber Novus.18 These seances were organised by the Hermetische Gesellschaft, a Swiss group founded in 1930 by Rudolf Bernoulli (1880–1948), an art historian and Tarot practitioner; Fritz Allemann (1884–1968), a banker and financier
who joined the Psychology Club of Zürich in 1930; and Oskar Rudolf Schlag
(1907–1990), an esoterically inclined psychoanalyst, graphologist, and Freemason,
whom Jung had met at the Burghölzli Clinic when Schlag was training there.19
The group was focused on the symbolism of the Tarot, but also held seances. Jung,
according to Schlag, was usually present at these seances until his expulsion ‘was
made necessary’ due to friction between Jung and Schlag.20 Although the Hermetische Gesellschaft was founded after Jung’s work on Liber Novus was completed, his
involvement reflects his continuing interest in the borderland between altered states
of consciousness as a spontaneous psychological phenomenon and the deliberately
provoked visions and experiences of automatic writing generated by what might
be understood as ritual magic.
Jung’s interest in the psychology of automatic writing was intense, as he strove
to understand both his own experiences and the inspirational or revelatory work of
other authors.21 F.X. Charet, in a work titled Spiritualism and the Foundation of C.G.



76 Active imagination and theurgy

Jung’s Psychology, argues persuasively that Jung’s early investigations, combined with
the popularity of spiritualism and hypnotic trance-states in the late nineteenth century, exercised a major influence on his later work.22 However, Charet’s suggestion
that spiritualism is the ‘foundation’ of Jung’s psychological models may overemphasise one factor over others that were equally important. Jung was an incurable morphologist. In an effort to confirm his various theories through historical evidence
as well as direct observation and experience, he sought to discern similar structural
patterns in widely diverse systems of thought and belief. It may therefore be unwise
to assume that any single current, whether religious, philosophical, or scientific,
ancient, medieval, or modern, provided the sole theoretical or practical foundation
for the technique of active imagination. Astrology was of great importance to Jung,
and he seems to have explored it, not only intellectually, but also through active
imagination; this application of astrology forms the subject matter of The Astrological World of Jung’s Liber Novus. But astrology, for Jung, was not a discrete entity in
itself. Rather, he perceived complex relationships between astrology and alchemy,
magic, ritual, symbol, individual psychological transformation, and collective shifts
in religious perception, and these interconnections preoccupied him throughout
his life.
Charet has also emphasised Kant’s philosophical discussions on the imagination as an important element in Jung’s efforts to reconcile spiritualist phenomena
with science.23 A cogent argument could also be made for a relationship between
active imagination and the Jewish Kabbalistic kavvanah, a form of meditation
intended to effect transformations both internally and within the infrastructure
of the godhead.24 And, given the number of works on practical magic in Jung’s
library – ancient, medieval, and modern – a persuasive case could be argued for
Jung’s experimentation with ritual magic as a psychological technique for inducing
altered states of consciousness.25 Jung’s Christian background likewise needs to be
considered in relation to active imagination; various Christian theurgic rituals –
especially the kind of intentional altered states developed in Eastern monasticism
as early as the fourth century ce – may have also provided important elements in
the development of Jung’s technique.26 These rituals were largely derived from
Neoplatonic practices, discussed more fully below, and were utilised by the early
sixth-century Christian philosopher Dionysius the Areopagite (‘Pseudo-Dionysius’), with whose work Jung had become familiar by 1921.27 In a seminar given
in 1939, Jung explicitly referred to the late antique Christian mystics as predecessors of the technique of active imagination, because they used directed fantasy to
achieve spiritual transformation.28
The ‘spiritual exercises’ of the sixteenth-century Jesuit priest Ignatius of Loyola,
which Jung placed in the same category, were sufficiently interesting to impel him
to deliver an entire lecture series on them at the ETH in Zürich in 1939.29 According to Loyola, the individual must learn to ‘see with the eyes of the imagination the
length, breadth and depth of hell’, and to respond to these visions with all of the
senses.30 Loyola is one of the most important Christian sources that Jung applied
to his ideas about active imagination. Jung also made a direct link between Loyola’s



Active imagination and theurgy

77

exercitia spiritualia and the Neoplatonic theories of the imaginal world offered by
Plotinus, Iamblichus, Porphyry, and Proclus.31 He referred to Loyola’s exercitia as a
‘special technique’:
It is a transformation experience induced by technical means . . . These
exercises represent special techniques prescribed in advance and intended to
achieve a definite psychic effect, or at least to promote it . . . They are, therefore, technical procedures in the fullest sense of the word; elaborations of the
originally natural processes of transformation.32
This description follows a statement about ‘magical procedures’ as a similar, technically induced form of psycho-spiritual transformation: ‘The rite is used for the
express purpose of effecting the transformation’.33 Religion and magic, in Jung’s
view, were evidently not as distinct from each other as was assumed by those scholars of his time who were influenced by Frazer’s view of magic as a primitive form
of religion that ‘commits the mistake of assuming that things which resemble each
other are the same’.34 The kind of magic that interested Jung was not concerned
with material gain, nor was it based on ‘mistaken’ analogies. Through the use of
symbols, it was focused on the transformation of the personality through a direct
experience of the archetypal dominants underpinning conscious life – modern psychological terminology for what was once understood as the unio mystica. Describing active imagination in more prosaic terms for the members of the Society for
Psychical Research (SPR) in London in 1919, Jung referred to it as ‘a means to
bringing unconscious contents to consciousness’.35 In this public setting, Jung was
not prepared to offer any hint of its religious and magical significance in earlier
sources or, for that matter, in his own private explorations, although he was in the
midst of working on Liber Novus when he gave his paper to the SPR.
Jung was not the only researcher at the time to cross the border into the liminal
zones. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a number of psychologists were experimenting with a wide variety of unconventional psychotherapeutic
techniques, such as automatic writing, crystal-gazing, and post-hypnotic suggestion,
in an effort to understand more about the nature and dynamics of the unconscious.36
Jung himself, from his descriptions of Elijah’s crystal in Liber Novus, evidently tried
out crystal-gazing (also known as ‘scrying’).37 The researchers exploring these
obscure avenues included William James (1842–1910), whose work seems to have
impressed Jung deeply; Herbert Silberer (1882–1923), whose book on the symbolism of alchemy was credited by Jung with providing the ‘connecting-link’ between
analytical psychology and Greek philosophy; and F.W.H. Myers (1843–1901), a
poet, classical scholar, philologist, and founding member of the Society for Psychical Research, who used automatic writing as a means of exploring the unconscious,
and whom Jung quoted in his own dissertation on spiritualist phenomena.38
This predilection for blending the occult with the psychological was favoured
in Britain, partly due to the quiet exchanges between certain psychotherapists
and various esoteric currents such as the Theosophical Society and the Hermetic



78 Active imagination and theurgy

Order of the Golden Dawn.39 The short-lived but immensely influential MedicoPsychological Clinic, for example, provided the first, albeit unofficial, psychoanalytic training in the United Kingdom, but its practitioners were consistently
engaged in scrying and automatic writing along with more orthodox methods of
psychotherapy.40 Jung was privy to, and happy to make use of, all of this research
carried out within his own profession.41 From a morphological perspective, a single
recognisable theme is evident in Jung’s sources for active imagination, expressed
through numerous cultural adaptations but possessing a structural integrity. This
theme rests on the idea that the human imagination, properly developed and
trained, can provide a mode of passage from one dimension of consciousness –
understood in psychological terms as ego-awareness – to another, more mysterious
dimension, referred to as ‘the unconscious’ and experienced by the individual as
compulsive, frightening, and, at times, numinous, transformative, and even indistinguishable from deity.
Robert Kugelman, who reviewed Liber Novus soon after its publication, calls
the work ‘visionary writing’, and has suggested that its roots lie in the traditions of
the German Romanticism of the early nineteenth century.42 Wouter J. Hanegraaff,
writing about ‘New Age’ spiritualities, likewise considers German Romanticism as
the primary source of Jung’s ideas about the imagination.43 The importance of the
Romantic writers for Jung’s work is inarguable, especially Goethe. But German
Romanticism did not spring into being full-blown through some kind of cultural
spontaneous generation. It was itself the heir of those same older philosophical and
religious currents – Gnostic, Hermetic, Neoplatonic, Kabbalistic – that Jung drew
on directly.44 If Jung identified with particular Romantic ideas, it may be partly due
to the fact that he recognised the traces of more ancient currents in the works of
Goethe, Novalis, and other authors of the Romantic movement.
Jung insisted that psychic energy, or libido,‘cannot appear in consciousness except
in the form of images’.45 This provides an apparently modern scientific understanding of such images: they are products of the deeper levels of the unconscious psyche,
emerging either spontaneously in dreams and visions or through deliberate invocation, and they give shape to otherwise incommunicable psychic realities. This view
was also promulgated by British occultists contemporary with Jung, such as Dion
Fortune (1890–1946), who had worked at the Medico-Psychological Clinic in
London before she joined the Order of the Golden Dawn:
The uninstructed person thinks he is developing psychism when he sees
elves, archangels, and elementals with the inner eye. The instructed person
knows that he is using a technique of the imagination in order to clothe with
visible form intangible things that would otherwise be imperceptible to his
consciousness.46
It is the precise nature of these ‘intangible things’ that has been the source of the
greatest controversy around Jung’s ideas about the unconscious. Fortune acquired
many of her concepts from Jung himself, as well as from the Freudian and Kleinian

79

approaches offered at the Medico-Psychological Clinic. She used Jung’s models
to support her belief that occultism and analytical psychology were complementary modes of exploring the invisible realms.47 But occultists such as Fortune, like
Jung, were familiar with the earlier sources, including Loyola and Iamblichus.48
The practice of ‘seeing with the inner eye’ long predates the psychotherapeutic
experiments of Charcot, Janet, James, Myers, and Silberer in the modern era, and
forms an important aspect of both alchemical and Kabbalistic theurgic techniques
of the medieval and early modern periods, as well as comprising a central theme
in late antique Gnostic, Hermetic, Jewish, and Neoplatonic literature.49 Although
Jung’s expositions on active imagination are psychological, they often, albeit covertly, attribute the qualities of divinity to the collective unconscious, reflecting a
panentheistic understanding of symbols as complex webs of associations that transcend the perceived opposites and paradoxically conjoin, in a single and apparently
discrete image, object, word, number, or glyph, the inner and the outer, the material and the psychic, within an unus mundus or unified cosmos which Plato, in the
fourth century bce, called the World Soul.50

Sumpatheia, sunthemata, and sumbola
Jung encouraged his patients to paint the images that arose from their imaginal
work, and there are numerous case studies in the Collected Works that present evidence of how efficacious this creative effort could be in aiding the process of
psychological integration.51 Sometimes Jung discussed his own paintings under the
guise of examples done by patients.52 This practice of painting the visual products
of the unconscious is encouraged by many Jungian analysts, but it has also spread
into other dynamic psychologies, especially those concerned with transpersonal
themes, and it provides the basis for some forms of art therapy.53 The enormous
detail and care with which Jung executed the paintings in Liber Novus is testimony
to how important it was to him to give concrete form to the images that emerged
in his interior explorations, including those he related to astrological symbols. Yet
strangely, Jung’s focus on the embodied image, which is amply explicated in numerous works by analytical psychologists as a therapeutic tool, has not been sufficiently
explored in terms of its history and its importance in theurgic practices.
Jung suggested that, by providing a container for the archetypal potencies, the
individual might be spared the often horrific experience of being inundated by the
collective unconscious, resulting in a psychosis.54 This kind of inundation seems
to have buffeted Jung during the period between 1913 and 1917, when he was
experiencing uncontrollable visions and believed that his house was ‘haunted’ by
the spirits of the dead. By providing a visual container for what he understood as
the irruption of the archetypal realm, he was able to maintain a reasonably stable
external life and preserve his psychotherapeutic practice. The traditions of theurgy
from late antiquity not only offered ample food for Jung’s hunger for a philosophical framework in which to embed his psychological insights; they also provided
explicit instructions on how to avoid the disintegration of the personality that can

accompany a confrontation with the divine. Neoplatonic theurgists such as Iamblichus eloquently expounded the reasons and methods for providing symbolic vehicles for the gods, and were equally eloquent about the terrifying consequences of a
mortal experiencing ‘possession’ by a deity without the protection of the appropriate sumbola.55
Central to Jung’s development of active imagination is his understanding of
symbols, which differs radically from the approach currently favoured within the
academy. Symbols today are understood within the fields of anthropology and sociology as human constructs relevant only within a specific cultural context.56 Mary
LeCron Foster, for example, expressing the functional perspective of many cultural
anthropologists, asserts that a symbol ‘is any entity that has socially participative
meaning’.57 The meaning perceived in symbols thus exists only in the concordant
minds of the participants in a given culture; symbols do not contain any ontically
intrinsic meaning, but are constructions that form the binding glue of societies and
their customs. The potency of a symbol in a particular culture, in LeCron’s view,
is determined by its ‘use-potential’, like the logo for a company or a household
product. The wider and more useful the application, the more potent is the symbol:
Symbolism arose and evolved into human culture because of a growing
appreciation and social utilization of abstract likenesses between objects and
events separated in time and space.58
In contrast, Jung’s view that the symbol ‘rises out of the depths of the self as a word
of power’ seems to have been derived from older sources, as well as from his own
direct experience.59 The impact of German Romanticism on Jung’s ideas about
symbols has been examined by a number of scholars: nineteenth-century authors
such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von
Schelling (1775–1854) are usually cited as the origin of Jung’s belief that symbols, and the mythic narratives that accompany them, express an ontic reality independent of the humans who articulate the symbols.60 But Jung also seems to have
directly appropriated Neoplatonic theories on the nature of symbols.61 This view of
symbols as the visible expression of an unseen reality rests on the idea of συμπαθεια
(sumpatheia) or ‘sympathies’, first given this name by the Stoic-Platonic philosopher
Poseidonius of Apamaea (135–51 bce). Sumpatheia expresses the affinity of all the
parts of the cosmos to each other and to the organic whole, resulting in mutual
interdependence along ‘chains’ of correspondences operating at different levels of
reality. As Iamblichus, borrowing from Plato’s Timaeus, put it: ‘The universe is a
single living being’.62
Sumpatheia provides the philosophical underpinning for the Neoplatonic understanding of and emphasis on astrology, since the planets, as celestial symbols in the
chain of interlinked cosmic emanations, are mirrored by, and inherent in, their
correspondences within both earthly reality and the human soul. Thus the ‘Chain
of the Moon’, in Proclus’ understanding, begins with the lunar deities Athene,
Artemis, and Hekate, all expressions of a specific emanation of the One. The chain



Active imagination and theurgy

81

continues down through the ‘Moon-soul’ to the physical Moon in the heavens, the
metal silver, the gemstone known as selenite, the vegetative power of nature, and the
fish known as ‘moonfish’.63 Although Proclus did not discuss the various dimensions of the human body and psyche as belonging to these chains, such associations
appear elsewhere in antiquity, especially in the idea of melothesia, where each organ
of the body is associated with a particular planet or zodiacal sign (see Plate 1),64
and in Galen’s elemental and planetary ‘humours’. These kinds of specific symbolic
chains abound in the images and text of Liber Novus.
This interlinking of the different levels and dimensions of the cosmos also provided a mode of understanding astral fate. The interaction of each part (or ‘cause’)
on every other part results in the chain of causation called Heimarmene, the Stoic
term for fate,65 eloquently described by the classical scholar Gilbert Murray in 1912:
Heimarmene, in the striking simile of Zeno [the founder of Stoicism], is like
a fine thread running through the whole of existence – the world, we must
remember, was to the Stoics a live thing – like the invisible thread of life
which, in heredity, passes on from generation to generation of living species
and keeps the type alive; it runs causing, causing forever, both the infinitesimal and the infinite.66
Causes, in Stoic thought, are not causes in the modern sense of ‘instrumental causality’,67 in which Event A makes Event B happen, and driving at 60 mph in a 30
mph zone ‘causes’ the flash of the speed camera and the inevitable fate of paying
a hefty fine. A Stoic ‘cause’ is a ‘body’, not an event, and causes operate on one
another. The Stoic Heimarmene is not a sequence of events causing other events, but
rather, ‘a simultaneous and mutual interaction’ between the different components
and levels of reality. In other words, a cause is a dynamic relationship that generates
further dynamic relationships.68 Jung seems to have utilised this ancient idea when
he compared the nature of a human relationship with the alchemical work: ‘For
two personalities to meet is like mixing two different chemical substances: if there
is any combination at all, both are transformed’.69
Poseidonius described individual souls as the ‘pieces’ (αποσπασμα) or ‘seeds’
(σπερματα) of the ‘intellectual fiery breath’ of the cosmos (πνευμα νοερον και
πυρωδεσ), akin to Plato’s World Soul.70 According to Poseidonius, there are
sympathies between all parts of this material divinity or divine matter, and Jung
would later use the term ‘psychoid’, referring to the ‘objective psyche’ or ‘collective
unconscious’ as both physical and psychic.71 The human soul is thus made of the
same stuff as the divine, and it is through this shared substance that theurgy acquires
its efficacy. Not only are human souls ‘pieces’ or ‘sparks’ of the World Soul; the gods
have embedded their tokens or ‘passwords’ (συνθεματα = sunthemata) throughout existence, and this encapsulates the Neoplatonic understanding of a symbol
(συμβολον = sumbolon).
Iamblichus and Proclus used the terms sumbolon and sunthema interchangeably to
describe the ‘receptacles’ or ‘tokens’ in material reality through which the gods may



82 Active imagination and theurgy

be contacted. The sumbolon operates on the basis of natural sympathies between
the deity and the manifest world. It is not a human social construct, but rather, the
expression of ineffable divinity in manifest reality. Rather than being created by
humans as social constructs, true symbols, for these philosophers as for Jung, are
discovered, because they embody divinity – or, in Jung’s terminology, the realm of
the archetypes – in the world, in the form of images. As Jung would later put it:
‘Myths . . . consist of symbols that were not invented but happened’.72 Symbols, for
Jung, are also gateways; they both embody and facilitate passage into a liminal zone
through which one may move from one dimension of reality to another.
If one accepts the symbol, it is as if a door opens leading into a new room
whose existence one previously did not know But if one does not accept the
symbol, it is as if one carelessly went past this door, and since this was the only
door leading to the inner chambers, one must pass outside into the streets
again, exposed to everything external . . . Salvation is a long road that leads
through many gates. These gates are symbols.73
The poet William Butler Yeats (1865–1939), a member of the Order of the Golden
Dawn and also an astrologer, phrased it in a similar fashion:
Symbols and formulae are powers, which act in their own right and with little consideration for our intentions . . . They are, indeed, personifying spirits
that we had best call Gates and Gate-Keepers, because through their dramatic
power they bring our soul to crisis.74
The word sumbolon is itself derived from συμβαλλειν (sumballein), meaning ‘to join
together’. A symbol thus expresses two aspects: it functions as the visible half of a
whole object, and it is a perceptible entity hinting at a pre-existing imperceptible
entity of which the symbol is an expression. In ancient Greek divinatory practice,
the term sumbolon also carried the notion of a meeting, an encounter, or a ‘bumping into’ something.75 Proclus used the term sumbolon to describe a particular
kind of relationship between a visible object (a planet, plant, flower, metal, or
gemstone) and unseen reality. Divine potencies ‘appear by concealing themselves
in form to us who have been endowed with form’,76 and these forms are symbols
that both conceal and reveal. Thus the physical Sun and the physical planets are
the forms that both conceal and reveal celestial divinities: the Sun conceals and
reveals Apollo and Helios, while the Moon conceals and reveals Athene, Artemis,
and Hekate.
In the Collected Works, Jung offered many definitions of a symbol, usually preferring an ontologically neutral context;77 but he also referred to symbols as ‘godimages’.78 In Liber Novus he presented a perspective very close to that of Proclus:
Sun and moon, that is, their symbols, are Gods. There are still other Gods;
their symbols are the planets.79



Active imagination and theurgy

83

The effects of reciting certain kinds of myth, according to Proclus, are similar to
those of religious or magical ritual. Myth is itself symbol, and every symbol embodies a mythic narrative. Symbol and sympathy are complementary notions; only
where a bond of sympathy links together the unseen and the visible are symbols
possible.
There is sympathy between all things, the derivative existing in the primal,
the primal reflected in the derivative . . . There are . . . myths which are
addressed to a more inspired state of soul and join together the lowest to the
highest by means of analogy alone and place the highest possible value on
that universal sympathy which joins effects with the causes that give birth to
them.80
For Proclus, the symbol is both the image and the embodiment of the god or daimon, and inherently possesses the power to awaken the bond between human and
divine:
To those few whose intellects have been awakened, they [Plato’s myths] reveal
sympathy and afford proof, by means of the workings of the sacred art [theurgy], that the power they possess shares its nature with the gods. For the
gods, when they hear such symbols as these, rejoice and readily heed those
who call upon them; they also reveal their special character through these
tokens [sunthemata] because they are their own, appropriate to them, and
most familiar.81
This perspective is so close to Jung’s own perception of the potency of symbols
that Neoplatonic theurgy as one of the major contributors to this most seminal of
his ideas cannot be ignored. It is unclear just when Jung encountered Iamblichus’
De mysteriis, as he did not cite this Neoplatonist in Psychology of the Unconscious, as
he did Plotinus and Proclus. But there are a number of references to Iamblichus in
Reitzenstein’s Poimandres as well as in his Die hellenistiche Mysterienreligionen, which
Jung referred to in 1912. Reitzenstein was convinced that Hermetic treatises, rather
than ancient Egyptian religious practices, provided the basis for Iamblichus’ theurgy.82 Mead, citing Reitzenstein’s comments, echoed this conviction, and offered
his own translation of sections of De Mysteriis in Thrice-Greatest Hermes, published
in 1906, declaring that Iamblichus
is of prime importance seeing that it was he who put the Later Platonic
School, previously led by the purely philosophical Ammonius, Plotinus and
Porphyry, into conscious touch with those centres of Gnosis into which he
had been initiated.83
It would be surprising if Jung had overlooked these references, especially as they
link Iamblichus’ theurgic practices to the Hermetic texts, with which Jung was



84 Active imagination and theurgy

already preoccupied while working on Liber Novus. It is more likely that he had
already acquired at least one of his editions of De mysteriis by 1912, although it
is unclear why he did not refer to it – perhaps because, unlike Plotinus, Iamblichus – despite Ficino’s efforts to ‘rehabilitate’ him during the Renaissance – was not
viewed by the scholars of the early twentieth century as a proper philosopher, but
as a proponent of magic and divination.84 Yet even Plotinus, although Mead called
him ‘purely philosophical’, was not averse to the practice of theurgy to achieve a
direct experience of the divine. Plotinus, however, preferred the term ‘contemplation’, defining its fruit as ‘a vision’ stirred by ‘an object of contemplation’ (in other
words, a symbol), and suggesting that the Platonic ‘Ideal Forms’ – or what Jung later
understood as the archetypes – could be experienced through such visions:
All the forms of Authentic Existence spring from vision and are a vision.
Everything that springs from these Authentic Existences in their vision is an
object of vision . . . All that springs from vision exists to produce Ideal Form,
that is a fresh object of vision, so that universally, as images of their engendering principles, they all produce objects of vision, Ideal Forms.85
Although some scholars credit the writers of the German Romantic movement with
promulgating in modern times the idea that symbols express an ontic reality independent of human consciousness, Jung turned to the Neoplatonic texts directly, and
did not rely solely on their later Romantic interpreters. These texts emphasised the
independent power of the symbol, which, according to Iamblichus, wields its transformative influence, not through human agency, but through the gods themselves.86
Anyone familiar with Jung’s later concept of ‘synchronicity’ – the ‘acausal connecting principle’ that mysteriously links apparently unrelated outer events with
inner psychic events – will recognise in this idea the underpinnings of sumpatheia,
renamed and shorn of its overtly religious connotations. In his letter to the French
astrologer André Barbault, Jung, responding to Barbault’s question about the modus
operandi of astrological configurations, was explicit about the equation between
synchronicity and sympathy:
It seems to me that it is primarily a question of that parallelism or ‘sympathy’
which I call synchronicity.87
The World Soul has been renamed the collective unconscious, and the gods have
become archetypes. But the idea that all things in the universe are secretly interconnected through invisible chains of symbolic correspondences remains unchanged,
as does the perception that the gods (or archetypes) themselves, through their
‘tokens’, are amenable to, and even desirous of, a dynamic interaction with human
consciousness that, for Jung, led toward some unknown goal:
There are other processes which bear within them a hidden meaning, processes which are not merely derived from something but which seek to
become something, and are therefore symbols.88

SUMMONING THE DAIMON

The personal daimon of each of us does not in any case come to us on the basis
of the configuration prevailing at our birth, but there is a yet more primordial
causal principle of him than this . . . Who after all, would take this figure as a
guide to freeing oneself from fate, if he has been given to us only for the purpose
of fulfilling the dispensations of fate? . . . It is the emanation from the stars that
allots us our daimon, whether we comprehend this or not.1
—Iamblichus

I prefer the term ‘the unconscious’, knowing that I might equally well speak of
‘God’ or ‘daimon’ if I wished to express myself in mythic language . . . I am aware
that ‘mana’, ‘daimon’, and ‘God’ are synonyms for the unconscious . . . A creative
person has little power over his own life. He is not free. He is captive and driven
by his daimon.2
—C.G. Jung

The chain of hieratic Platonism
During the time Jung worked on Liber Novus, a number of sources – astrology,
spiritualism, scrying, hypnosis, German Romanticism, and Christian mysticism,
along with liberal helpings of Aristotle’s De anima and Plato’s Timaeus, Gnostic and
Hermetic texts,3 and the experimental researches of his fellow psychiatrists – contributed major insights to Jung’s ever-deepening speculations on the agency and
transformative power of the imaginal world. As we have seen, an equally strong case
can be made for the influence of the Neoplatonists, as well as those works belonging to what John Dillon has referred to as the ‘underworld’ of Platonism: the magical rituals of the Chaldaean Oracles and the so-called Mithras Liturgy.4 These works
of late antiquity, in various translations, made up an important part of Jung’s private



90 Summoning the Daimon

library.5 He even went to the trouble of obtaining a rare Latin first edition of Iamblichus’ De mysteriis, translated from the Greek by Marsilio Ficino and published in
Venice in 1497,6 although it is unclear when he acquired it. The influence of Neoplatonism on the philosophy and art of the Italian Renaissance has been discussed
in depth by numerous scholars, as has its impact on the ‘occult revival’ of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.7 Jung availed himself not only of texts
from late antiquity, but also the works of Renaissance and early modern interpreters
such as Marsilio Ficino and Henry Cornelius Agrippa, as well as occultist writings
from his own time. In order to make sense of Jung’s approach to astrology, it is
important to understand in what ways he took up this current of ideas and applied
it to active imagination, particularly in relation to astrological symbols.
The chain of ‘hieratic’ or ‘priestly’ Platonism8 – Platonic philosophical ideas
translated into ritual action – runs from Plotinus and Porphyry through Iamblichus
to the later Neoplatonists: Proclus, Olympiodorus, and Damascius, the last head of
the Platonic Academy in Athens before the Christian Emperor Justinian closed it
down in 529 ce in an effort to rid his empire of the taint of pagan heresy.9 All of
these authors produced commentaries on Plato’s dialogues; all incorporated astrology as a central component in their cosmological speculations as part of the web of
sumpatheia; and all were preoccupied with the more enigmatic elements in Plato’s
work, which they believed hinted at magical applications of philosophical truths.
Recent scholarship has begun to focus more carefully and with less prejudice on
the elements of ritual magic presented by this enormously influential current in late
antique philosophy and religion.
The magical ‘underworld’ of Platonism, which permeated various currents of
Gnostic thought as well as the Greek Magical Papyri, might appear very different
from the apparently purely philosophical and daimon-free Christianised Platonism
of Church fathers such as Origen and Gregory of Nyssa.10 Nevertheless, these less
reputable texts espoused a world-view that Jung seemed to find relevant for his
psychological models. The world of hieratic Platonism valorised the imagination,
the ontological autonomy of symbols, and the importance of inner experience.
The borders between philosophy and religion are blurred in this liminal world, as
are the borders between religion, psychology, and magic. Jung seems to have been
very fond of Plotinus,11 generally considered the ‘founder’ of Neoplatonism, who,
in contrast to his successors, has usually been viewed by scholars as a mystical philosopher rather than a theurgist.12 But Plotinus may have been important to Jung
for reasons other than the purportedly ‘rational’ mysticism of the Enneads. In recent
times a number of scholarly papers have explored the overtly magical elements in
Plotinus’ work. Jung credited Plotinus with being ‘an earlier witness to the idea of
the unus mundus’ because this Greco-Egyptian philosopher declared that all individuals ‘are merely one soul’. Jung thus viewed him as a predecessor, along with
Plato himself, of the idea of the collective unconscious.13
Jung also perceived Plotinus’ description of the soul’s natural movement ‘around
something interior, around a centre’ as a foreshadowing of his own concept of the



Summoning the Daimon

91

FIGURE 4.1 Head of Plotinus, late third century ce, Museo Ostia Antica14

Self, the centre around which the various components of the psyche circle.15 In
Memories, Dreams, Reflections, Jung emphasised the importance of this centrifugal
movement in the development of his idea of individuation:
During those years, between 1918 and 1920, I began to understand that the
goal of psychic development is the self. There is no linear evolution; there is
only a circumambulation of the self. Uniform development exists, at most,
only at the beginning; later, everything points toward the centre.16
Plotinus’ Enneads, written around 250 ce and edited by his student Porphyry, were
first published in English as a series of volumes between 1917 and 1930.17 An earlier German translation with a lengthy commentary appeared in 1907,18 and Jung
seems to have acquired this edition during the period in which he wrote Psychology of the Unconscious and began work on Liber Novus. He later obtained Stephen
MacKenna’s English translation as well as a modern critical edition of the Greek



92 Summoning the Daimon

text.19 Jung cited liberally from the Enneads in Psychology of the Unconscious, placing
particular emphasis on Plotinus’ description of the World Soul, which, in Jung’s
paraphrase, is ‘wholly energy’ and ‘a living organism of ideas’: a mirror of the concept of libido as universal psychic energy generating, and expressing through, the
archetypes.20 Jung also referred to Plotinus’ equation of the primal creative principle with ‘light in general’, symbolised by the Sun:21
The dynamic of the gods is psychic energy. This is our immortality, the link
through which man feels inextinguishably one with the continuity of all
life . . . The psychic life-force, the libido, symbolizes itself in the sun.22
Equally important for Jung was Plotinus’ Fourth Ennead, titled On the Nature of the
Soul, in which the philosopher expounded his views on the primary importance of
the imagination as the gateway between visible and invisible realms. The power of
magic, according to Plotinus, depends on sumpatheia, ‘like a musical string which,
plucked at one end, vibrates at the other also’.23 The third tractate of the Second
Ennead, titled Are the Stars Causes?, was especially relevant to the development of
Jung’s ideas about astrology. In this work Plotinus dismissed the idea that the planets
‘produce’ effects in a material manner. They ‘signify’ rather than cause events; they
are ‘letters perpetually being inscribed on the heavens’.24 They are, in fact, sumbola:
All teems with symbol . . . All things must be enchained; and the sympathy and correspondence obtaining in any one closely knit organism must
exist, first, and most intensely, in the All . . . And in this order the stars, as
being no minor members of the heavenly system, are co-operators contributing through their radiance to its symbolic function. Their symbolic power
extends to the entire realm of sense.25
This might be understood as the Plotinian version of what Jung later referred to
as synchronicity, through which he explained in neutral, scientific language the
efficacy of astrology. In Plotinus’ seminal text, astrology is the interpretation of the
divine sumbola of the heavens, which embody and reflect, in their cyclical motions,
the ever-changing patterns inherent in the World Soul or, in Jung’s terminology,
the libido. This Plotinian understanding of the symbolic nature of the heavenly
configurations appears to underpin Jung’s observation, made in his letter to Freud,
that the zodiacal signs ‘depict the typical qualities of the libido at a given moment’.
For Jung, as for Plotinus, the planets and zodiacal signs are not material causes, but
symbols.
Jung’s interest in Orphic ideas, demonstrated by the importance of the Orphic
primal god Phanes in Liber Novus and the description of Phanes as the ‘cosmogenic
principle’ in Psychology of the Unconscious,26 may have been sparked by the Orphic
poems cited by later Neoplatonists such as Damascius and Olympiodorus, which
were translated into English as The Mystical Hymns of Orpheus by the Platonic scholar
Thomas Taylor in 1824.27 Richard Reitzenstein likewise discussed the Orphics in



Summoning the Daimon

93

Die hellenistischen Mysterienreligionen,28 as did Isaac Preston Cory in Ancient Fragments, and Erwin Rohde in Seelencult und Unsterlichkeitsglaube der Griechen;29 Jung
acquired all three of these works, the first two (and possibly the third) by the time
he began work on Liber Novus.30 Mead had produced his own commentary on
what he called the Orphic ‘theology’ in 1896, frequently citing Taylor’s translation
of the Hymns;31 and, given the importance of Mead’s work for Jung’s understanding of late antique religious currents, Mead’s views on the continuity of Orphic
ideas in Neoplatonism may also have captured Jung’s interest. Taylor, who believed
the Orphic Hymns to be faithful to ancient Presocratic originals, declared, in the
introduction to his translation:
That this theology, indeed, was derived from Orpheus is clearly testified by
those two great philosophic luminaries Iamblichus and Proclus.32
Jung found Proclus interesting too, and, in addition to the many translated passages
offered by Mead in his work on the Orphics, acquired a treatise by this late Neoplatonist titled Select Theorems in Proof of the Perpetuity of Time, translated by Taylor
and embedded in a compilation that included other authors writing on the great
astrological cycles.33 Proclus’ writings on time provided another useful source for
Jung’s explorations into the paradoxical, qualitative, and cyclical nature of time as
reflected in the symbols of the zodiac and the movements and interrelationships of
the planets. This matrix of materials emphasises the central importance of astrology
as a demonstration of the laws of sumpatheia, the nature of planetary ‘influence’ as
symbolic, and the validity of magic as a means of breaking the chains of astral fate.
These ideas seem to have preoccupied Jung’s reading and research from the time of
the inception of Liber Novus if not earlier, reflected in the various themes found in
Liber Novus as well as in the references in Psychology of the Unconscious, published in
German a year before work on Liber Novus had begun.

The ‘Divine’ Iamblichus
Although Jung referred more often to Plotinus in the Collected Works, the ‘Divine’
Iamblichus may be one of the most significant sources from antiquity on which
Jung drew for his ideas about active imagination and his use of astrological hermeneutics to comprehend its products.35 Iamblichus, like Plotinus, embraced the
importance and veracity of astrology, but he distinguished between ordinary predictive astrology as a humanly constructed form of divination subject to human
error, and theurgic astrology, which employs images and symbols to contact the
astral potencies and receive direct knowledge from them.36 Surprisingly, despite the
strong similarities between Iamblichus’ descriptions of the philosophy and practice of theurgy and Jung’s descriptions of active imagination, this Syrian Neoplatonist is usually overlooked when scholars explore earlier contributions to Jung’s
most important analytic technique.37 That Jung was fully aware of the relationship
between active imagination and magic is evident in a comment he made about his



94 Summoning the Daimon

FIGURE 4.2 A seventeenth-century engraver’s conception of Iamblichus Chalcidensis34

patients in a lecture given at the Tavistock Clinic in 1935. He was also describing
his own experiences while writing Liber Novus.
I have patients who, evening after evening, work at these images, painting and
shaping their observations and experiences. The work has a fascination for
them; it is the fascination which the archetypes always exert upon consciousness . . . It is a sort of ‘magical’ effect, that is, a suggestive influence which
goes out from the images to the individual, and in this way his unconscious
is extended and is changed.38
The ‘suggestive influence’ emanating from the image echoes Iamblichus’ declaration that the transformations of the soul achieved through theurgy rest on ‘secret
symbols’ sent by the gods:
Beings beyond form brought under the control of form, things superior to all
image reproduced through images.39



Summoning the Daimon

95

The word ‘theurgy’ has a long history and, like so many other terms connected
with the human religious imagination, it is subject to ongoing scholarly debate,
particularly around its distinction from, or identity with, magic. There is, as yet, no
agreed scholarly consensus on precisely what the term describes.40 The original
Greek theurgos (θεοργος) is a neologism – theos + ergon (θεος + εργον), or ‘godwork’ – which first appeared in the late antique ritual text known as the Chaldaean Oracles, a work with which Jung was familiar and which exercised a powerful
influence on Iamblichus’ interpretation of hieratic Platonism.41 The Oracles, known
primarily through fragments cited by other authors, are usually considered magical
rather than philosophical. Nevertheless, the philosophy underpinning the text is
unmistakably Neoplatonic. The extant fragments concern the invocation of various
celestial gods and daimons, an approach presented in ample detail in that large and
diverse body of magical literature stretching from the late antique Greek Magical
Papyri through the grimoires of the medieval and early modern periods and on to
the occult texts of modern magi such as Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, and Israel
Regardie in the early twentieth century.
Theurgy is often described by its practitioners as a ‘higher’ form of magic, concerned with communion or even union with the gods rather than with the imposition of the magician’s will on everyday life. Theurgy does not involve the coercion
of higher powers, but relies on the gods’ willingness to respond to their own symbols or sunthemata.42 It is thus viewed as closer to the idea of prayer, a theme on
which Iamblichus himself expounded:
Prayer establishes links of friendship between us and the gods, and secures
for us the triple advantage which we gain from the gods through theurgy,
the first leading to illumination, the second to the common achievement of
projects, and the third to perfect fulfilment (of the soul) . . . No sacred act can
take place without the supplications contained in prayers.43
Some of the debate around theurgy centres on this interface between magic and
prayer. If Iamblichus is understood to be describing a serious religious practice,
then it is difficult to ignore the parallels with Christian performative events such
as the Mass, which is then difficult to define as anything other than theurgy: a
combination of ritual action and recitation, symbolic objects, focused imagination,
and prayerful supplication. A close reading of Jung’s Liber Novus likewise renders
it difficult to consider the operations that led to the text and images as anything
other than theurgy. Liber Novus also combines ritual action and recitation, symbolic
objects in the form of paintings, focused imagination, and prayerful supplication,
including a lengthy incantation to facilitate the birth of the Sun-god from the
cosmic egg.44
Jung was ambiguous in his discussions about prayer, and seems to have shifted
over the years in his understanding of its meaning and effectiveness. In Psychological
Types, he was concerned with the psychology of prayer rather than its ontology. Citing Paul Deussen’s German translation of and commentary on Hindu sacred texts,45
Jung pointed out that the word ‘prayer’ derives from the Hindu barh, meaning ‘to



96 Summoning the Daimon

swell’; prayer is thus ‘the upward-striving will of man towards the holy, the divine’.
Jung then stated that this etymological root
indicates a particular psychological state, a specific concentration of libido,
which through overflowing innervations produces a general state of tension associated with the feeling of swelling. Hence, in common speech, one
frequently uses images like ‘overflowing with emotion’, ‘unable to restrain
oneself ’, ‘bursting’ when referring to such a state . . . This accounts for all
those sun, fire, flame, wind, breath similes that from time immemorial have
been symbols of the procreative and creative power that moves the world.46
However, the ‘creative power that moves the world’ was already evidencing itself in
the images of Liber Novus as something rather more potent than a ‘feeling of swelling’. It is likely that, even in 1920, when he wrote the passage cited above, Jung
never assumed the effects of prayer to be solely a form of emotional ‘overflowing’
projected onto an imagined deity.
The carefully revised and rewritten material of the Collected Works was Jung’s
legacy to a public in general, and a psychiatric profession in particular, whose derision he feared. In an essay on the archetypes first published in German in 1936,47
Jung discussed the differences between the often ‘heretical’ visions that contain the
raw archetypal dominants behind religious ideas, and the more conventional visions
which ‘agree with the dogma’ and are ‘visualizations of conscious contents, evoked
through prayer, autosuggestion, and heterosuggestion’.48 Prayer, in this latter context,
is merely a form of autosuggestion that follows collectively acceptable formulae and
produces collectively acceptable religious ‘experiences’.49 However, nearly twenty
years later, in a letter to the Roman Catholic priest Père William Lachat, Jung wrote:
I do not for a moment deny that the deep emotion of a true prayer may reach
transcendence, but it is above our heads.50
Prayer, for Jung, could thus open the gateway to a transcendent mystery that defies
psychological explanations.
Iamblichus, like Jung, was concerned with distinguishing between images produced through deliberate human agency and images arising from the true gnosis
experienced through theurgy. Book III of De mysteriis is dominated by descriptions
of ‘true’ divination, dreams, and prophecy initiated and inspired by the divine, in
contrast to the ‘turbulent and false’ visions artificially produced through technical
means. Imagination, as distinct from mere fantasy,
is inspired because it is not roused by itself, but by the gods, to modes of
imagination when normal human behaviour has been completely displaced.51
Paraphrased according to Jung’s terminology, the imagination is roused by the
archetypes themselves, when their intrusions ‘displace’ the ‘normal’ functioning of



Summoning the Daimon

97

the conscious ego. Iamblichus insisted that the theurgist achieves his or her object –
absorption into the divine – through the correct ritual performance of certain
magical actions which may be incomprehensible to the theurgist, but whose significance is known to the gods.52 The ritual was understood to be a kind of dialectic
between the human soul and the god or daimon; divine willingness to participate is
set in motion by the symbols of the ritual act, which are the sunthemata of the divine
embedded in the manifest world, and which ensure that the deity participates in the
theurgic process. Transformation results, not through the power of the human will,
but through the autonomous power of the divine symbols.
Iamblichus also distinguished between theurgy and ordinary magic or sorcery
(γοητεια = goeteia):
Do not, furthermore, compare the clearest visions of the gods to the images
produced artificially from magic, for these have neither the energy, nor the
essence of things seen, nor truth, but present mere images, reaching only as
far as appearance.53
While theurgy is concerned with divine things, goeteia is ‘readily accessible and
widespread among the vulgar throng’, employs ‘falsehood and deceit’, and ‘enjoys
the presence of no god’. Its practitioners, moreover, ‘overlook the whole procedure
of effective contemplation’.54 Jung, in contrast, did not offer any comments on the
distinction between theurgy and ‘lower’ magic. The word ‘theurgy’ does not appear
in the Collected Works, although, not surprisingly, Jung had a great deal to say about
magic.55 He described magic as encompassing both light and dark dimensions, since
its potency arises from those primordial levels of the psyche that predate ‘splitting’:
The magician has preserved in himself a trace of primordial paganism, he
possesses a nature that is still unaffected by the Christian splitting, which
means he has access to the unconscious, which is still pagan, where the opposites still lie in their original naive state, beyond all sinfulness, but, if assimilated into conscious life, produce evil and good with the same primordial and
consequently daimonic force.56
The British occultists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries used
the words ‘magic’ and ‘theurgy’ interchangeably, to dignify the kind of magic they
practiced and to provide an ancient pedigree stretching back to hieratic Platonism.
Iamblichus is frequently acknowledged in their work.57 Israel Regardie (1907–85),
a member of an offshoot of the Order of the Golden Dawn known as the Stella
Matutina, produced a work on Kabbalistic magic called The Tree of Life, which
Jung acquired along with another of this author’s works. Regardie made the debt
to Iamblichus explicit:
I hope to show that the technique of Magic is in closest accord with the
traditions of highest antiquity, and that it possesses the sanction, expressed or



98 Summoning the Daimon

implicitly, of the best authorities. Iamblichus, the divine Theurgist, has much
to say in his various writings about Magic.58

Jung’s hieratic paintings
A comparison of Iamblichus’ views with Jung’s reveals the immense relevance of
the Syrian Neoplatonist’s ideas about theurgy to Jung’s technique of active imagination. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that active imagination is not only
a psychological technique; viewed within a different linguistic framework, it is a
carefully structured theurgic ritual, albeit an ‘inner ritual’ that does not require
concrete sumbola such as incense, plants, or gemstones.59 However, the paintings in
Liber Novus can themselves be viewed as hieratic sumbola, as could the stone Jung
carved at Bollingen, with its planetary glyphs surrounding the figure of Telesphoros
at the centre.60 Jung incorporated precise details in the images of Liber Novus, such
as a certain type of tree or animal, and may have intended to achieve the same end
as Iamblichus’ material sumbola.61 The image of the grove of date-palms in Jung’s
painting of Philemon, for example, can serve the same theurgic purpose as an actual
branch of the tree. This raises questions about the complex relationship between a
physical object and its image in a dream, vision, or magical invocation, and between
the object and the image as it appears in an artistic work. If Jung’s paintings are
intentional sumbola in Iamblichus’ sense, just how spontaneous were they?
Jung’s original visions were recorded in a series of diaries known as the Black
Books, which he began writing in December 1913.62 He continued writing entries
in the Black Books until 1932. But these diaries, which Jung referred to as ‘my
most difficult experiment’,63 were selectively revised, edited, honed, chiselled, and
ornamented to produce the single volume we now know as Liber Novus. Images
such as that of Philemon, whose initial appearance Jung claimed to have seen in
a dream, were painted with immense thought, care, and detail; there are earlier
‘draft’ versions, such as one that he painted in 1914, reproduced in Gerhard Wehr’s
biography of Jung published in 1987.64 In this earlier painting, Philemon appears as
Jung described him in Memories, Dreams, Reflections: he is crowned with a solar halo,
bears bull’s horns, and, like Mithraic statues of the god Aion, holds a ring of keys in
his right hand.65 In the final version of the painting produced for Liber Novus, the
bull’s horns are missing and the keys have vanished, replaced by a glowing stone,
although the solar halo remains. In these different presentations of Philemon, what
John Thorburn referred to as ‘the selective meditation of the artist’ has resulted in
a synthesis of the fluid and the formal, or, as both Thorburn and Jung described it,
a synthesis of the unconscious and consciousness.66
The deliberate inclusion of detailed symbolic references in Jung’s paintings
does not preclude their potency as genuine spontaneous visions. Instead, it transforms them into works of art. A similar question about spontaneity might be raised
around the material generated in automatic writing, which is inevitably subjected
to the filter of the individual’s conscious selectivity when it is transcribed, edited,
and prepared for publication.67 Likewise, the descriptions, both verbal and visual,



Summoning the Daimon

99

that follow in the wake of a ‘mystical’ experience, now referred to as a ‘unitive’
experience or ‘religiously altered state of consciousness’, partake of the individual’s
selective awareness the moment they are communicated.68 Both automatic writing
and ‘religiously altered states of consciousness’ are terms that might justifiably be
applied to Liber Novus, which describes encounters that Jung perceived as transpersonal, and which reflects ideas and images that he experienced as coming from an
autonomous, unknown source.
Late antique ritual texts such as the Chaldaean Oracles have been described as
automatic writing, akin to the trance-utterances of spiritualist mediums. E.R. Dodds,
one of the most influential classical scholars of the mid-twentieth century, described
the Oracles as originating ‘in the “revelations” of some visionary or trance medium’.69
The most vivid example of Jung’s ‘automatic writing’ is the third section of Liber
Novus, titled ‘Scrutinies’, completed in the winter of 1917. Jung attributed his revelations to the ‘voice’ of Philemon. The scholarly debate on whether such experiences
are entirely culturally determined, or whether they contain some kind of essential,
ineffable core, continues without any resolution as to the precise nature and origin
of the experience.70 As with astrology itself, the conflict between direct experience
and lack of scientific ‘proof ’ seems irreconcilable. Although Jung’s visionary material
appears to have been genuinely spontaneous initially, there may be no such thing as
complete spontaneity in terms of the process by which this type of experience is
translated into words, images, or any other medium through which an artist works.
That the paintings may have also been intentional talismanic sunthemata does not preclude the power, authenticity, and genuine autonomy that Jung attributed to them.

Epitedeiotes: ‘fitness’, ‘aptitude’, or ‘receptivity’
Jung emphasised the magical power of the unconscious by citing the great medieval
magus, Albertus Magnus (c. 1206–80):
A certain power to alter things indwells in the human soul and subordinates
the other things to her, particularly when she is swept into a great excess of
love or hate or the like. When therefore the soul of a man falls into a great
excess of any passion . . . it [the excess] binds things [magically] and alters
them in the way it wants.71
Jung suggested that the images that arise from the unconscious during such states of
intense emotional affect ‘present themselves spontaneously’.72 He was in complete
accord with Iamblichus’ insistence that it is the god or daimon who initiates the
encounter: ‘The god acts by himself ’.73 For Jung, it was the archetypes of the collective unconscious that act by themselves and require a respectful and receptive response:
You must enter into the process with your personal reactions . . . as if the
drama being enacted before your eyes were real . . . It is as real as you – as a
psychic entity – are real.74



100 Summoning the Daimon

The lines of communication are thus opened between seen and unseen worlds,
and between the individual psyche and the collective unconscious or, in Neoplatonic terms, the World Soul.75 Jung described the magical process of opening
the portal as a necessary aspect of engagement with the unconscious, in order to
‘receive or invoke the messenger’.76 His emphasis on respectful attentiveness to the
images echoes Iamblichus’ idea of επιτεδειοτες (epitedeiotes): ‘fitness’, ‘aptitude’, or
‘receptivity’. Iamblichus understood the ‘soul-vehicle’ or ‘astral body’ – the quasispiritual, quasi-corporeal intermediary binding the soul to the body – as the locus
of the image-making faculty or phantasia. During the theurgic ritual, the phantasia
is emptied of all personal images and becomes receptive to the images sent from
the gods.77
Iamblichus used the idea of epitedeiotes to explain why not everyone could
achieve the highest mystical states during theurgy.78 Although the gods were everywhere, they could not be ‘received’ by those who, intentionally or not, lacked
receptivity.79 In the fifth century ce, the Neoplatonic philosopher Hermias, a contemporary of Proclus, applied the same idea to the prophetic inspiration conferred
by the personal daimon:
Not everyone is aware of his daimon; for one to be conscious of its care, there
needs to be great suitability [epitedeiotes] . . . For, just as all things are subject to
the providence of the gods, though not all have consciousness of this, unless
they have the natural ability to see and are purified, so it is also with regard
to the supervision of the daimon.80
Jung believed that the ego needs to possess both willingness and the capacity to
endure a confrontation with the deeper levels of the unconscious. Like Iamblichus’
epitedeiotes, this involves fitness as well as receptivity. If consciousness is too fragile,
psychosis can ensue through the overwhelming of the ego by the archetypal dominants of the collective unconscious.81 But if consciousness is too rigidly defended,
the unconscious may somatise its irruptions, or express itself through compulsions
experienced as ‘fate’.82
Equally, the individual cannot simply summon the archetypal dominants by an
act of will, but must await the significant symptom, dream, vision, or life crisis,
expressed as kairos, the ‘right moment’. The capacity to discern this ‘right moment’
would seem to depend partly on the appropriate qualities of time (in other words,
the correct astrological configuration), and partly on epitedeiotes. Both Iamblichus
and Jung emphasised a dynamic relationship between the individual and the universal. In this relationship, human consciousness is an active recipient, not a passive,
unwilling victim. The images of the gods, according to Iamblichus, then take possession of the phantasia, allowing an experience of true revelation.83 The psychological and philosophical implications of the idea of epitedeiotes are profound. The
human being, properly prepared and protected by the appropriate sumbola, is able
to meet the archetypal realm, not as the powerless subject of astral or psychic fate,
but as a respectful co-creator.



Summoning the Daimon

101

The ‘master of the house’
Theurgy, in Iamblichus’ view, moves hand in hand with astrology, although it is not
the astrology of horoscopic prediction. Following a tradition originating with Plato
and taken up by Plotinus and Porphyry,84 Iamblichus spoke of a ‘personal daimon’
(οικειος δαιμων or ιδιος δαιμων), the ‘overseer and leader of our soul’, who directs
the individual’s life and acts as ‘the fulfiller of the various levels of life of the soul’.85
The daimon does not guide just one or another part of our being, but all of
them at once, and it extends to us the whole administration of us, even as it
has been allotted to us from all the regions of the universe.86
Plotinus had earlier described the personal daimon as ‘the power which consummates the chosen life’, insisting that it is ‘not entirely outside of ourselves . . . it
belongs to us as belonging to our Soul’.87 Following this idea of the daimon as an
intensely individual, interior potency, Iamblichus, in a letter to an unknown recipient, referred to this divine being as ‘the daimon allotted to each in life’.88 In De
mysteriis, he was more specific. The soul has only one ruling daimon in a particular
lifetime; in order to fulfil its requirements, one must first recognise and develop a
rapport with it.89 This can be fully achieved only through theurgy, during which
the daimon ‘reveals his particular mode of worship as well as his name’, and ‘teaches
the particular manner of invoking him’.90 The personal or guardian daimon is synonymous with the individual’s destiny, the ‘suprarational personality that controls
the whole of our lives’.91 Rapport with the ‘personal daimon’ seems to be precisely
what Jung intended in his invocation of Philemon.
Iamblichus enumerated two means of discovering and experiencing this celestial intermediary who facilitates the unfolding of the destiny of the individual life.
The ‘technical’ method involves the natal horoscope, as the personal daimon was
believed by most late antique astrologers to be reflected by the dominant planet at
the moment of birth. Porphyry, in his Letter to Anebo, discussed the idea of finding
the personal daimon through an examination of the natal horoscope.92 The astrological significator of the personal daimon was given the designation οικοδεσποτης
(oikodespotes) or ‘Master of the House’.93 In his Introduction to the Tetrabiblos, Porphyry gave precise technical instructions to ascertain the oikodespotes in the horoscope, but conceded that ‘there is much dispute about this’.94 The dispute continued
for centuries, reflecting individual religious as well as astrological predilections.95
In Iamblichus’ view, such technical methods of revealing the oikodespotes are
useful, but inferior to true gnosis. They operate on the ‘merely human level’, and
therefore involve guesswork and potential mistakes:
Following the former [theurgic] procedure, one summons the daimon down
from the higher causal principles, while according to the latter [technical],
one resorts to the visible cycles of the generated realm [the natal horoscope] . . . The former operates on a more universal basis, transcending the



102 Summoning the Daimon

realm of nature, while the latter conducts its worship on an individual level,
following the dictates of nature.96
Theurgic invocation of the daimon thus reflects its archetypal (universal) nature,
while its representation in the horoscope reflects its expression in the particular
conditions of an individual life. The two methods can be combined: revelation
of the daimon through theurgy can sometimes be achieved through meditation
on the images associated with the planet signifying the oikodespotes. Equally, the
planetary sunthemata, such as a specific flower or gemstone, may be helpful in the
ritual work, as these sunthemata, in Iamblichus’ view, are, like other ‘natural’ symbols,
divine ‘tokens’ that the gods have embedded in the world of form.97
It is unlikely that Jung utilised the complex array of techniques offered by late
antique astrologers to determine the oikodespotes;98 there is no evidence that he
had access to any of their texts.99 Nor is it certain that he would have attempted
the techniques even if he had possessed an entire library of Hellenistic astrological works, as he disliked the mathematical aspects of casting a horoscope and later
recruited his daughter Gret to do the calculations for him.100 Gregory Shaw, discussing Iamblichus’ approach to the oikodespotes, suggests that the Master of the
House was usually considered the planetary lord of the natal Ascendant – the zodiacal sign rising in the east at the moment of birth – providing that planet was strong
and well-related to the other planets. The idea of the Ascendant ruler as the ‘lord’
of the entire nativity reappeared, shorn of its daimonic and theurgic associations, in
the new, ‘modern’ astrology initiated by Alan Leo at the beginning of the twentieth
century. This undoubtedly made everything much simpler for Jung.101
The Ascendant ruler in Jung’s natal chart is Saturn, as he was born when that
30° segment of the ecliptic known as Aquarius was rising due east of his birthplace,
and Saturn is traditionally the lord of this zodiacal sign. Jung’s natal Saturn does in
fact fulfil Porphyry’s more detailed requirements for the oikodespotes,102 as it is strong
by virtue of being placed in its own sign of Aquarius as well as rising in the east
and forming benign relationships to several other planets.103 Not surprisingly, Saturn figured prominently in Jung’s writing throughout his life. Saturn is constantly
mentioned in the Collected Works due to its overwhelming importance in alchemy.
Here it was said to ‘reign’ during the initial phase of the alchemical work, known
as the nigredo or ‘blackening’104 – a process which Jung associated with the necessary breaking down of the ego’s defences prior to any authentic engagement with
the unconscious – and was understood to be the primal substance or matrix out of
which eventually emerged the ‘Philosopher’s Stone’, the chief alchemical symbol
of the Self.105
In Liber Novus, a number of figures reveal unmistakably Saturnine sumbola, culminating in Philemon, whose relationship to this planet is indicated by his age,
his lameness, his function as a generator of ‘order’ and ‘law’, and his central role
as magician and ‘Wise Old Man’.106 That Jung deliberately invoked Philemon
through active imagination is explicitly stated in Memories, Dreams, Reflections;107
that this daimonic figure is Saturnine in nature is evident from Jung’s various



Summoning the Daimon

103

descriptions of him; that he was Jung’s personal inner guide was also clearly stated
by Jung himself. These references, in addition to Jung’s mention of ‘old Saturnus’ as
his ruler, strongly suggest that Philemon’s close family resemblance to the ancient
Neoplatonic ‘Master of the House’, invoked through theurgy as well as defined by
the horoscope, is not coincidental.
There is more than one interpretation of the nature of the daimon offered in
ancient texts. Gábor Betegh, the translator of the Orphic fourth-century bce Derveni Papyrus, has observed: ‘The semantic field of the word δαιμων is distressingly
wide in Greek usage’.108 The term ‘daimon’ is derived from the Greek daiomai,
meaning ‘to allot’ or ‘to divide’,109 and the daimon is thus related to the idea of
moira, which means ‘allotment’ and is one of the Greek representations of fate,
conceived of as both an allotted span of life and its teleology. Moira is in turn etymologically related to Heimarmene, a term which, as we will see in the next chapter,
Jung used repeatedly as a synonym for astral fate. This complex of ideas – daimon,
allotment, and astrological fate – forms a core theme in late antique theurgy and
astrology, as well as in Jung’s ideas about individuation as fate.
Daimons may be understood as ‘lesser’ gods; as semi-divine messengers or intermediaries, similar to the mediating angels in Jewish, Islamic, and Christian religious
thought; and as the souls of the deceased, who mediate between celestial and terrestrial realms but who can also vengefully impede the soul from pursuing its ascent
to freedom. In the Derveni Papyrus, the unknown author noted that the daimons
‘are called assistants of the gods’.110 The Derveni Papyrus also presents the idea of a
‘personal daimon’ assigned to each soul. As the Orphic poem on which the text is
based predates Plato by at least a century, it is likely that Plato acquired this idea, like
so many others, from Presocratic Orphic currents.111 The daimon could be inborn,
or it could exist independent of the person it accompanied. It was not always perceived as ontologically ‘outside’, but could also be interior. As Heraclitus suggested
in the sixth century bce, two and a half millennia before the German Romantics
took up the idea: ‘Man’s character is his daimon’.112
James Hillman (1926–2011), whose school of archetypal psychology relies heavily on Jung but differs in its overtly declared debt to the pagan polytheism of the
Neoplatonists, devoted a work to the ancient idea of the daimon, titled The Soul’s
Code. Hillman defined the daimon as an ‘individualised soul-image’:113
The soul of each of us is given a unique daimon before we are born, and it
has selected an image or pattern that we live on earth. This soul-companion,
the daimon, guides us here . . . The daimon remembers what is in your image
and belongs to your pattern, and therefore your daimon is the carrier of your
destiny.114
The individual’s physical body, parents, and place and time of birth – in other words,
not only environment and genetic inheritance but also the natal horoscope – are all
‘chosen’ because they belong to the necessity of the daimon, who is both ‘outside’
the configurations of the horoscope and ‘inside’ because the seminal moment of



104 Summoning the Daimon

birth reflects the soul’s own choice. Discussing the nature of Jung’s daimonic visitations, Hillman noted:
He [Jung] did call up voices from the deep, and these are daimons, in the
Greek sense of the word . . . These were figures from the middle world. They
were not necessarily only from the underworld. They were the mediators in
a way but they were living figures.115

The ‘holy guardian angel’
The ‘personal daimon’, in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic adaptations, eventually
merged into the figure of the ‘guardian angel’.116 The word ‘angel’ is derived from
the Greek angelos, meaning ‘a messenger’, divine or human, and the term was sometimes used for gods who served as messengers, such as Hermes and Iris.117 Jung used
the term ‘messenger’ in Liber Novus to describe such a being:
We need magic to be able to receive or invoke the messenger and the communication of the incomprehensible.118
But the Abrahamic guardian angels are not, in traditional theological currents,
understood as interior, nor are they concerned with the teleology of the horoscope. They are, quite literally, messengers sent from heaven by God to protect the
individual. This applies especially to the Christian angels, who, after the official ‘deanimation of the heavens’ that occurred in 1277 at the request of Pope John I, lost
their ancient astral associations and became obedient servants of God in a celestial
world that was now perceived as a gigantic clockwork mechanism designed, created, and managed, but no longer inhabited by, divinity.119
Guardian angels are thus usually understood as ontologically separate from the
human soul. It is only in the borderlands of Jewish and Islamic esoteric currents that
the interior nature of this personal angel is described as an aspect of the divine spark
within the human being. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there emerged
within the Jewish communities of the diaspora, influencing and influenced by
Islamic mystical speculation, explicit descriptions of the guardian angel or maggid
as an image of the highest aspect of the soul. These exegeses drew on a syncretic
base that adapted, within a Jewish religious framework, a number of Neoplatonic
and Greco-Egyptian magical ideas and rituals from late antiquity,120 and combined
them with an already well-developed Jewish magical tradition believed to stretch
back to Solomon and Moses.121 The texts emerging from these Jewish esoteric currents acknowledged the astral nature of the angels and their responsiveness to ritual
invocation.122 As magic was international in the late antique world and tended to
cross religious boundaries, the guardian angel in Jewish magic bears a close family
resemblance to the personal daimon of the Neoplatonists.123
Although ontically autonomous, the guardian angel may also be found within,
constituting that element of the human being consubstantial with divinity, and



Summoning the Daimon

105

capable of being theurgically invoked through the organ of the imagination. Such
speculations and rituals were taken up by heterodox Christians whose work was
well known to Jung, such as Dionysius the Areopagite in the late sixth century and
Henry Cornelius Agrippa in the late 16th.124 These theurgic practices provided the
basis of most of the medieval and early modern grimoires: the foundation texts of
the Western magical tradition, replete with angelic and demonic forms whose gifts,
coaxed or coerced, could sometimes lead to the angelification of the human being.
The invocation of an angelic ‘higher Self ’ also appeared in the currents of Jewish
esotericism in the medieval period. Abraham ibn Ezra (1089–1164), a Jewish polymath, astrologer, and philosopher of the twelfth century, whose work was known
to Jung,125 described the angelic upper worlds in a manner closely resembling the
mundus imaginalis presented by Iamblichus, in which, through theurgic ritual, the
human can experience a ‘natural and indivisible’ connection with the divine.126
The imagination, through which these celestial worlds may be perceived, is the
‘spiritual body’ or ‘spirit vehicle’ of the soul.127
Ibn Ezra proposed that the human soul derives originally from this celestial
realm.128 Each of the stars and planetary spheres likewise has its own soul and strives
to return to its source, in the same manner that the human soul does. Ibn Ezra specifically referred to these planetary and stellar souls as angels, making a direct link
to the astral daimons described by Porphyry and Iamblichus.129 The human being
seeking an experience of the higher realms must learn to see through ‘the pupils of
your heart’.130 Through knowledge of one’s own soul, the individual as microcosm
can discover knowledge of the universe as macrocosm; the angels can be accessed
from within because they are within. Ibn Ezra’s idea of the goal of the inner journey
echoes that of late antique theurgy: the individual is transformed through a direct
experience of the divine. In Jung’s psychological terminology, individual consciousness is transformed through a direct experience of the Self.
In medieval Jewish esoteric circles, complex theurgic rituals were developed,
intended to facilitate a vision of the divine that might culminate in the angelification of the human.131 The work of Eleazar of Worms (1176–1238) continued to
resonate into and beyond the early modern period through magical compilations
such as the Sefer ha-Raziel (‘Book of the Angel Raziel’), yet another work with
which Jung was familiar.132 Eleazar, like ibn Ezra, adopted the idea of the Neoplatonic ‘spirit-vehicle’, made of the same substance as the angels and itself an angelic
form; through this image of divinity within the human, called the tselem, the upper
worlds could be accessed.133 Eleazar understood this interior angel to rule the zodiacal sign under which the individual is born:
Every angel who is an archon of the zodiacal sign of a person when it is sent
below has the image of the person who is under it . . . And this is the meaning
of ‘And God created man in his image’.134
Each individual thus has an inner astral angel when he or she is born into the physical world. Eleazar’s ‘archon of the zodiacal sign of a person’ mirrors the Neoplatonic



106 Summoning the Daimon

idea of the oikodespotes in the natal horoscope, as it refers, not to the sign in which
the Sun was placed, but to the planetary ruler of the Ascendant. This is a profoundly
psychological understanding of the angelic entity: the form of the angel is the
imaginal expression of a psychic dimension of the individual, which in turn incarnates in human shape a celestial complex of astral qualities and meanings embodied
in the soul and its fate in mortal life.

Jung’s grimoires
One of the most important magical texts of the medieval period is known in
Latin as Liber Razielis or ‘Book of Raziel’.135 This work is especially relevant for
any discussion of Jung’s ritualistic use of the imagination.136 Liber Razielis is a Latin
translation of the Hebrew Sefer ha-Raziel.137 It contains large portions of the work
of Eleazar of Worms, and was also the chief source for the early modern grimoire
known as Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses – a text in Jung’s library that, in Liber
Novus, he described as the property of the magician Philemon.138 Because Moses,
like a number of other grimoires, involves dialogues with daimonic beings related
to planetary and zodiacal significators, it is a work of astral magic, rooted in an
astral cosmology which can be traced back to Gnostic, Hermetic, early Jewish, and
Neoplatonic origins. Not surprisingly, Moses was not the only grimoire that Jung
acquired. There are a number of other texts of this kind in his library, and they
might be better understood as theurgic because they deal with an ascent of the soul
to a form of gnosis or unitive experience, and are not primarily concerned with
‘lower’ goeteia. It seems that, by the time he commenced work on Liber Novus, Jung
was already intrigued by magic and the psychological transformations that could
result from ritually performed techniques utilising the imagination as a gateway.
The magical work perhaps best known to those outside the circle of scholars of
medieval and early modern magic is Henry Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim’s
sixteenth-century bible for aspiring magicians: De occulta philosophia, a three-volume
comprehensive treatise on astrology, alchemy, and Kabbalistic magic. Agrippa, like the
author of Moses, relied on the Sefer ha-Raziel for his source material.139 Jung possessed
two editions of Agrippa’s text in German, one published in 1855 and the other in
1916,140 as well as two rare early Latin editions, published respectively in 1584 and
1653, of another of Agrippa’s works, On the Vanity of All Arts and Sciences.141
Equally significant in relation to Liber Novus, Jung also acquired a grimoire
published in German in the early eighteenth century, purportedly by a medieval
Jewish magus called Abraham of Worms,142 titled Buch der wahren Praktik in der
uralten göttlichen Magie und in erstaunlichen Dingen.143 This book, divided into four
parts, is the first printed version of a work known in English as The Book of Abramelin. According to Lon Milo DuQuette, who wrote the foreword for a new English
translation published in 2006, the original manuscript was written between 1387
and 1427.144 A large portion of Book Three of Abramelin, concerned with the invocation of various astral angels and spirits, is duplicated in the Sixth and Seventh Books
of Moses.145 Abramelin was first translated into English at the end of the nineteenth



Summoning the Daimon

107

century by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, one of the founders of the Order
of the Golden Dawn.146 Through Mathers’ translation and the publicising of the
book’s rituals by Aleister Crowley, as well as the publication of two new twentyfirst-century editions in English and German, Abramelin remains a popular work in
contemporary occult circles.147
Abramelin presents a specific astrological and angelogical ritual that its author
claimed was taught to him by a Jewish-Egyptian mage called Abramelin. The
object of the Abramelin ritual, which requires eighteen months of arduous preparation involving fasting, abstinence, and various psycho-spiritual exercises, is a form
of gnosis resulting in the transformation of the magus and the power to command
‘unredeemed’ spirits. According to Mathers, the book’s first English translator, the
purpose of the ritual is
By purity and self-denial to obtain the knowledge of and conversation with
one’s Guardian Angel, so that thereby and thereafter we may obtain the right
of using the Evil Spirits for our servants in all material matters.148
Following the long period of ritual preparation, according to Abraham,
I experienced this vision in humility and bliss for three continuous days. I was
addressed lovingly and with friendship by my guardian angel. He explained
the godly wisdom and Kabbalah and later completely explained the complete
truth about this magic.149
Something very similar could be said about Jung’s Philemon, who, according to
Liber Novus, taught Jung the secrets of magic. In DuQuette’s view, the Holy Guardian Angel of Abramelin ‘is a divine entity uniquely linked to each individual – in
essence the magician’s personal spiritual soul mate’.150 Although DuQuette proposes antecedents in Indian yogic practices, the source of this idea in Western
magical currents in the medieval period is more likely to lie in the Neoplatonic
concept of the oikodespotes and the Jewish idea of the maggid – although both were
generally invoked for the transformation of the soul, rather than as a means through
which ‘unredeemed’ demons could be summoned.151
Although it is unlikely that Jung concerned himself with summoning unredeemed spirits except in the psychological context of his concept of the ‘shadow’ –
the problematic or unacceptable elements of the personal unconscious152 – it is not
difficult to understand why he was interested in Abramelin from a psychological
perspective. Philemon, in Judaeo-Christian religious contexts, might be understood
as a form of guardian angel as well as an archetypal image of the wisdom of the
collective unconscious. It is also unlikely that Jung would have missed the parallels
between the ‘Holy Guardian Angel’ of Abramelin and the Neoplatonic oikodespotes.
Both enjoy a liminal status that is inner and psychological as well as objective
and celestial; both are denizens of the mundus imaginalis; and both act as a bridge
between individual microcosm and universal macrocosm. It is possible that Jung



108 Summoning the Daimon

may have attempted the Abramelin ritual in a form adapted to his psychological
understanding of Iamblichean theurgy, the Neoplatonically inspired astral magic
developed by Marsilio Ficino in the late fifteenth century,153 and Loyola’s exercitia,
and experienced the presence of an imaginal inner guide whom he referred to as
‘my psychagogue’, and whom he called Philemon.154
That Jung was deeply interested in ritual magic is hardly surprising, as the
boundary between magical practices and psychological explorations is a fragile
and constantly shifting one. Jung’s investigations moved beyond the late antique,
medieval, and early modern grimoires to the literature of contemporary magical
orders such as the Fraternitas Saturni, whose journals he acquired for a brief period
in the late 1920s, and which promulgated the idea of an imminent new ‘Age of
Aquarius’ governed by the planet Saturn.155 Sonu Shamdasani notes that a work was
published in 1912 by Ludwig Staudenmaier, a German professor of chemistry, titled
Magic as an Experimental Science; this book describes Staudenmaier’s experiments
with ‘automatic writing’ and deliberately induced visual hallucinations. The aim of
Staudenmaier’s efforts was, according to Shamdasani, to ‘provide a scientific explanation of magic’.156 Jung possessed a copy of this work and marked several passages
in it. Restricted by the conventions and cultural expectations of his time and his
profession, Jung nevertheless found the courage to acknowledge the importance of
this liminal zone where psychological insights could be found in the applications of
ritual magic to the development of human consciousness through the imagination,
that ‘organ of the soul’ through which invisible worlds could be accessed.
Evidence that Jung practiced as well as read about magic – or, perhaps more
accurately, theurgy – does not automatically indicate that he was a ‘believer’ in
the sense that Agrippa and MacGregor Mathers were, or that he invoked astral
entities every evening before bedtime. For Jung, everything, in the end, needed
to be understood within the context of human psychology. Magic is a theme that
unquestionably looms large in Liber Novus. And astral magic – those rituals concerned with invoking and navigating an ascent of the soul through the planetary
spheres, in order to break the compulsive chains of astral fate – likewise features
prominently as a psychological theme in various volumes of the Collected Works.
A magical ritual to invoke the Sun-god appears in Liber Novus, inspired in part by
the ritual invocation in the Mithras Liturgy; a similar type of invocation, echoing a
number of themes in Thomas Taylor’s English translation of the hieratic Orphic
Hymn to Protogonos, appears in one of the Black Books, dedicated to the new god of
the Aion, the Orphic primal deity Phanes.157 As for the ‘real’ nature of whatever it
is that responds to such invocations, Jung viewed these entities as imaginal personifications of the archetypal potencies of the collective unconscious. That, however,
is not an explanation likely to comfort those who expect to find rigorous scientific
verification in the liminal zones.

Friedrich Creuzer, Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker (Leipzig: K.W. Leske, 1810–
12). Creuzer had also translated into Latin the works of Plotinus and Proclus. For Creuzer’s Neoplatonic translations, see Georg Friedrich Creuzer (trans.), Plotini Enneades cum
Marsilii Ficini Interpretatione Castigata (Paris: Dübner, 1855). For the relationship between
Jung’s ideas and those of the Neoplatonists, see James Hillman, ‘Plotino, Ficino, and Vico
as Precursors of Archetypal Psychology’, in James Hillman, Loose Ends (Zürich: Spring,
1975), pp. 146–69; Bruce MacLennan, ‘Evolution, Jung, and Theurgy’, in Robert Berchman and John F. Finamore (eds.), History of Platonism (New Orleans, LA: University Press
of the South, 2005).
6 Another edition of De mysteriis that Jung acquired was Pierre Quillard (trans.), Le livre
de Jamblique sur les mystères (Paris: Libraire de l’art indépendant, 1875). Jung referred to
Iamblichus’ De mysteriis in CW9i, ¶573 and his Vita Pythagorica in CW18, ¶1521, indicating familiarity with both works, although he never discussed Iamblichus’ theurgy in the
Collected Works.

14 Head of Plotinus from Museo Ostia Antica, Inv. 436. This head is one of four replicas
all of which were discovered at Ostia. The identification as Plotinus is probable but not
proven.
15 Jung, CW9ii, ¶342, citing Plotinus, Ennead VI, in Stephen MacKenna (trans.), Plotinus
(London: Medici Society, 1917–30), originally published in six volumes, later reissued in
one volume (London: Faber & Faber, 1956). See below, n. 17.
16 Jung, MDR, p. 222.
17 The standard older English translation is MacKenna’s Plotinus. A more recent English
translation is A.H. Armstrong, trans., Plotinus, 7 volumes (Loeb Classical Library, 1966–
88). The Greek word enneas (εννεας) means a collection of nine objects or entities,
from εννεα, meaning nine. Porphyry edited his master’s writings into fifty-four treatises
of varying lengths, setting each of these into an enneas or group of nine dealing with
a specific theme; there are thus six of these groups, providing the basis for MacKenna’s
six-volume translation.
18 Arthur C. Drews (trans.), Plotin und der Untergang der antiken Weltanschaunng ( Jena:
E. Diederichs, 1907). Drews published a work in 1910, Die Christusmythe ( Jena: E. Diederichs, 1910), which related ancient astrological speculations to the origins of religion
and the hidden structure of the Gospels. Not surprisingly, Jung acquired this work as well
as Drews’ translation of Plotinus.

the Orphic Hymns in Psychology of the Unconscious (p. 544, n. 34), but without any reference to the translator; but in Jung, CW5, the revised version of Psychology of the Unconscious, the reference is the same, and this time Taylor’s translation is cited (¶528, n. 62).

pp. 35–58; John Dillon (ed. and trans.), Fragments of Iamblichus’ Commentary on the Timaeus
(Leiden: Brill, 1973).
37 Iamblichus’ theories on the mediating role of the imagination are explained in a still
highly respected work by Murray Wright Bundy that Jung acquired at some point
after its publication in 1927: The Theory of Imagination in Classical and Medieval Thought
(Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1927).
38 Jung, CW18, ¶407. The lecture, originally given in 1935, appeared first in published
form in C.G. Jung, Analytical Psycholoy (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1968).
39 Iamblichus, De mysteriis, I.21. Clarke, Dillon, and Hershbell (De mysteriis, p. 79, n. 112),
suggest that the term sunthemata here describes ‘the various magical substances and combinations of substances that form the basis for theurgic practice’.
40 For the history of the term ‘theurgy’, see Lewy, Chaldaean Oracles, pp. 461–66; E.R.
Dodds, The Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1957),
pp. 283–310.
41 See Shaw, Theurgy and the Soul, pp. 40–42; Garth Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993), pp. 1–2, 86–87. A translation of and commentary on the Chaldaean Oracles was published in two volumes by G.R.S. Mead (London:
Theosophical Publishing Society, 1908). Jung naturally acquired this work.

57 Gregory Shaw has emphasised that the work of these modern occultists ‘should not be
ignored by scholars’, because it provides useful evidence of modern appropriations of
Iamblichean theurgy; see Shaw, ‘Theurgy’, p. 4, n. 12.

67 Examples are the works of H.P. Blavatsky, Alice A. Bailey, and Max Heindel, all of whom
attributed their work to highly evolved disincarnate entities. For Jung’s views on ‘automatic writing’ or ‘psychography’, see Jung, CW1, ¶¶28, 45, 49, 88, 96; Jung, CW18,

69 E.R. Dodds, ‘Theurgy and Its Relationship to Neoplatonism’, Journal of Roman Studies
37:1–2 (1947), pp. 55–69, on p. 58. Jung was familiar with the Oracles through Mead’s
translation as well as Cory’s Ancient Fragments, which notes on p. 355 the equation in the
Oracles of the primal power with fire.
70 The wealth of scholarly literature on this theme ranges from cognitive science to theological speculation. Jung was strongly influenced by James’ The Varieties of Religious
Experience. For Jung’s own discussions, see the essays in Jung, CW11. For more recent

95 For example, Macrobius, a fifth-century author with whose work Jung was familiar,
maintained in his Saturnalia that the personal daimon is always represented by the Sun
in the horoscope. See Macrobius, The Saturnalia, trans. Percival Vaughan Davies (New
York: Columbia University Press, 1969), I.19.16–18, p. 136. For Jung’s references to the

96 Iamblichus, De Mysteriis IX.1, 273.2–9.
97 Iamblichus did not offer a list of these sunthemata in De mysteriis. But see Proclus, Commentary on Plato’s Timaeus, I.3.10, in which the plant called heliotropius (whose flower
turns its head following the Sun) and the gemstone known as bloodstone (a form of
green jasper mottled with red) are described as sunthemata of the Sun.
98 In medieval Arab astrology, the oikodespotes was called alcocoden, the ‘Guardian Angel’ or
‘Giver of the Years’. For the alcocoden, see James R. Lewis, The Astrology Book (Canton,
MI: Visible Ink Press, 2003), pp. 18–19, 346–47.
99 Although Iamblichus, Plotinus, Porphyry, and Proclus were well represented in Jung’s
library, Jung does not seem to have acquired Porphyry’s introduction to the Tetrabiblos, nor
any manuscripts from other Hellenistic astrologers concerned with the oikodespotes, mainly
found in the Catalogus Codicum Astrologorum Graecorum published between 1898 and 1953.

‘THE GREAT FATE’

Man’s character is his fate.1
—Heraclitus

Fate and soul are but two names for the same principle.2
—Novalis

The ancients devised magic to compel fate. They needed it to determine outer
fate. We need it to determine inner fate and to find the way that we are unable
to conceive.3
—C.G. Jung

A rose by any other name
Like the roads that lead to Rome, any discussion of Jung’s astrology leads, sooner or
later, to the question of how he understood fate. Astrology and philosophical speculations about fate have been cohabiting intimately since the origins of both. A number of modern astrological texts have addressed in more contemporary language the
question of whether an individual’s fate is described by the horoscope. Sometimes
other words with different nuances are used, such as ‘destiny’.4 Many astrologers in
the second half of the twentieth century began to reject the idea of fated circumstances altogether, and referred to ‘trends’ rather than the ancient idea of Heimarmene,
the ‘compulsion of the stars’. An example of this modernising of astral fate was
offered by the British astrologer Jeff Mayo (1921–98), who declared categorically:
An astrological aspect with regard to the future can correspond with any one
of a variety of possibilities, mostly dependent upon the ‘freedom of choice’



118 ‘The great fate’

of the individual concerned, yet the aspect still foretells the actual trend of
circumstances, or the nature of the individual’s reaction to the situation.5
Other astrologers accepted the idea of astral fate in principle, but suggested that it
involves only the physical circumstances of the individual, and not the soul. This
quasi-Platonic, quasi-Gnostic approach was expressed by the British astrologer
Margaret Hone (1892–1969) in 1951:
Inasmuch as a man identifies himself with his physical self and the physical
world about him, so he is indissolubly part of it and subject to its changing
pattern as formed by the planets in their orbits. Only by the recognition of
that which he senses as greater than himself can he attune himself to what is
beyond the terrestrial pattern. In this way, though he may not escape terrestrial happenings, by the doctrine of free and willing ‘acceptance’ he can ‘will’
that his real self is free in its reaction to them.6
This perspective allows a form of freedom as well as an acknowledgement of fate; but
it reflects a dualism of spirit and matter that was alien to Jung’s own view of their unity.
In antiquity, the ways in which astral fate was understood varied among different
philosophical and religious systems. Certain Hermetic fragments claimed that astral
fate acts upon the body, or on the lower dimensions of the soul, but the higher soul
or nous remains free from its influence:
We have the power to choose; it is within our power to choose the better, and
in like way [to choose] the worse, according to our will. And if [our] choice
clings to the evil things, it doth consort with the corporeal nature; [and] for
this cause Fate rules o’er him who makes this choice. Since, then, the intellectual essence in us is absolutely free . . . on this account Fate does not reach it.7
This is the view echoed by the astrologer Margaret Hone in the mid-twentieth
century. Certain Gnostic treatises, such as the Apocryphon of John,8 present the idea
that each planetary archon places a kind of psychic membrane over the human soul
as it descends into incarnation, resulting in a soul-vehicle of seven layers, each under
the governance of one of the seven archons.9 These layers, collectively called the
‘counterfeit spirit’, were perceived as malign, reflecting the idea that the planetary
archons bind the soul to matter through libidinous compulsions, and obstruct the
soul’s recollection of its divine source.10
Within early Christian contexts, the idea of Heimarmene remained an important theme in theological discourse, but astral fate was viewed as powerless against
those who had undergone Christian baptism. In the medieval period, largely due
to the teachings of the Dominican priest and Aristotelian philosopher, Thomas
Aquinas (1225–74), the dualist approach presented in Hermetic and Gnostic treatises resurfaced as an acceptable Christian concept. A fate dictated by the stars was
understood to pertain to physical desires and needs, since the body belonged to the



‘The great fate’

119

corruptible ‘sublunar’ realm in the context of Aristotelian cosmology (see Plate 2).
But the soul belonged to God and was beyond the reach of astral influences.11
Modern philosophers have come to no more inclusive agreement than their
ancient predecessors.12 The term ‘fate’ has been replaced by ‘determinism’, a word
less prone to religious associations and adaptable to economic, climatic, social, and
political rather than astral powers. Astrology has naturally been dropped from these
modern philosophical discourses. But Jung remained profoundly concerned with
the problem of fate in relation to the heavenly bodies. He looked to Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche for philosophical illumination, but he turned to the Neoplatonists, Stoics, Hermeticists, and Gnostics for more practical insights into the
dilemma – not least because, in these older currents, astral fate lies at the centre of
the discourse. Modern psychologies and psychiatries are also concerned with the
question of fate. However, in cognitive and behavioural schools of psychology, as in
philosophy, astrological discourse has largely vanished,13 and fate is usually called by
other names. In the field of organic psychiatry, it is increasingly enmeshed with the
study of genetics, and is now referred to as ‘genetic fate-mapping’.14

Nature, nurture, and reincarnation
The role of causality in human psychic suffering invariably leads back to that mystery surrounding fate, whatever synonyms might be adopted to replace the word.
For example: are people born inherently ‘bad’ – genetically programmed (and thus
fated) to do ‘bad’ deeds – or do they become ‘bad’ (and thus equally fated) through
the pressure of external circumstances they did not choose? And if it is the latter, do
they have any choice later or, given the right social and clinical resources, the possibility of healing? Two general approaches have arisen which form the backbone of
the so-called nature-nurture debate in modern psychologies. The first conclusion,
rooted in the theory of ‘classical conditioning’ developed by the Russian physiologist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov in the early twentieth century, embraces a perception of
the human being as a tabula rasa (‘blank slate’) influenced entirely by environmental
conditioning. Psychotherapeutic approaches based on this view are now known
under the general umbrella of ‘behavioural’ therapies.15 The second conclusion,
also causal, is based on a purely biological view, in which the chemistry of the brain
determines the psycho-physical future of the individual.16 A middle way between
these two extremes may also be adopted, in which physiology (nature) and environment (nurture) are both implicated, in varying degrees, in the formation of
personality. In his early psychiatric work, it seems that Jung attempted this kind of
compromise, declaring:
The endless dilemma of culture and nature is always a question of too much
or too little, never of either-or.17
By the time he began work on Liber Novus, however, Jung seems to have adopted
a third approach. It was favoured in late antiquity but is unpopular today within



120 ‘The great fate’

the fields of medicine and organic psychiatry because it is acausal and resistant to
demonstration through scientific methodologies. This approach involves a perception of the fate of the human being as embodying an a priori inherent character,
Self, or soul-constellation that mysteriously expresses itself through the outer circumstances of an individual’s life. The source and nature of this inherent ‘essence’
remains hidden, hinting at a more intuitive mode of speculation or, at the very least,
the admission that ‘proving’ its existence is impossible within current research paradigms. The idea of an inherent temperament independent of, but complementing,
both genetic inheritance and environment suggests a meaningful teleology of inner
development, rather than static bondage to preordained circumstances. It may also
be accompanied by the understanding that the intent of this essence – personified
by the daimon – is reflected in the qualities of time described by the patterns of
the natal horoscope.
This approach eventually seems to have dominated Jung’s thinking on fate. In
antiquity, the idea was usually accompanied by belief in successive incarnations of
the soul; each human lifetime, its individual daimon, and its specific fate are shaped
by the choices made in the previous lifetime.18 The greater the individual’s awareness of this fact, the more he or she is able to make conscious choices and develop
creatively within the limits of that which cannot be changed. This results in greater
harmony between the individual and the intent of the daimon. The idea of a series
of incarnations, in which the ‘karma’ or psychic substance accrued in a given lifetime generates the challenges and rewards of the next lifetime, has had a very long
life in Western esoteric currents, resurrected in modern times by Blavatsky and
her followers through assimilating Hindu and Buddhist thought to Platonic and
Neoplatonic concepts and lacing both with a distinctively Christian morality. Alan
Leo, who embraced the idea wholeheartedly and incorporated it into his astrological writings, insisted that astrology ‘has no permanent value’ without incorporating
the reality of former lives.19
That Jung was receptive to the idea of reincarnation, in later life and possibly
earlier, is indicated by a statement in Memories, Dreams, Reflections:
Somewhere ‘out there’ there must be a determinant, a necessity conditioning the world . . . This creative determinant . . . must decide what souls
will plunge again into birth . . . It is possible that any further spell of threedimensional life would have no more meaning once the soul had reached
a certain stage of understanding; it would then no longer have to return . . .
But if a karma still remains to be disposed of, then the soul relapses again
into desires and returns to life once more, perhaps even doing so out of the
realisation that something remains to be completed.20
Jung also speculated on what ‘remains to be completed’ in his own life:
It must have been a passionate urge toward understanding which brought about
my birth . . . I could well imagine that I might have lived in former centuries



‘The great fate’

121

and there encountered questions I was not yet able to answer; that I had to be
born again because I had not fulfilled the task that was given to me.21
Jung referred to reincarnation in the context of the Eastern concept of karma, and
he also recognised its importance in Platonic and Neoplatonic literature; moreover, he was fully aware that modern Theosophical speculations borrowed from
both. The link between the natal horoscope and the cycle of rebirth was described
explicitly by Annie Besant (1847–1933), who became president of the Theosophical Society in 1907:22
The karma of past lives, mental, emotional, and in relation to others, demands
materials capable of the most varied expressions . . . According to this temperament will be the time of the birth of the body; it must be born into the
world at a time when the physical planetary influences are suitable, and it thus
is born under its astrological ‘star’. It is not the star that imposes the temperament, but the temperament that fixes the epoch of birth under that star.23
Jung insisted that the idea of rebirth ‘is inseparable from that of karma’.24 He repeatedly encountered in Alan Leo’s books the conviction that rebirth and karma are
themselves inseparable from the moment of physical birth and the horoscope based
on it. Although Jung did not relate rebirth and karma to astrology in any published
work, it seems to have underpinned much of his understanding of his own horoscope, particularly in terms of what he viewed as ‘what remains to be completed’.

Fate and individuation
Jung embraced the older, acausal view of fate during, or soon after, his break with
Freud. In Psychology of the Unconscious, he indulged in one of his favourite pastimes:
etymological associations, in this case connecting the Greek word for fate, Moira,
with various words related to the Indo-European root mer or mor, meaning ‘to
die’. He related these words in turn to the Roman divine ‘mothers’, the Matres or
Matronae, who are both the Teutonic Norns and the Greek Moirai.25 This kind
of imaginative association of words, word roots, and symbols is an aspect of Jung’s
thought that can be challenging to those who think of language as a purely semantic, culturally constructed instrument of communication. But whether or not Jung’s
analogical digressions comprise a ‘scientific’ method,26 by the time he began work
on Liber Novus he had already made the equation between fate and soul.
This may reflect the influence of German Romantic writers such as Novalis. It
may also reflect Jung’s study of astrology, especially the kind of astrology presented
by Alan Leo, which led him to what he perceived as a clear demonstration of the
a priori existence of a character structure mirrored by, or synchronous with, the
natal horoscope. The inseparable intertwining of fate and character was presented
by Leo in a work titled Saturn: The Reaper, which Jung seems to have acquired soon
after its publication in 1916. In the foreword to this work, Leo declared: ‘Character



122 ‘The great fate’

is destiny’.27 For Jung, the qualities of time itself, reflected in astrological symbols,
constitute astral fate, since time, as Jung declared, ‘is often the symbol of fate’.28
The moment of birth is thus a kind of snapshot, incarnated in flesh, of those ‘typical qualities of the libido at a given moment’. Jung’s deep and ongoing concern
with the nature of fate might be expected in someone whose work was dedicated
to understanding and healing psychic suffering. There are many references to the
conundrum of fate and free will in the Collected Works, as well as in Memories,
Dreams, Reflections and Dream Analysis. In 1912, a year before he began work on
Liber Novus, Jung identified fate with the archetypes:
The effect of the unconscious images has something fateful about it. Perhaps –
who knows – these eternal images are what men mean by fate.29
In Psychology of the Unconscious, Jung called fate the ‘driving force of the libido’:
The power of fate makes itself felt unpleasantly only when everything goes
against our will; that is to say, when we no longer find ourselves in harmony
with ourselves . . . The power of fate reveals itself at closer range as a compulsion of the libido.30
This observation is a profoundly interior perception of fate, expressed not in terms
of external events, but as those inner compulsions that thwart every good intention
of consciousness and result in unconscious choices which entangle the individual in
painful external circumstances that have no easy resolution. Astral fate is described in
this manner in a number of Gnostic and Hermetic texts, which Jung believed provided him with ‘the historical counterpart of my psychology of the unconscious’.31
In an essay titled ‘Psychology and Religion’, first given as a series of lectures in
1937, Jung expressed succinctly his conviction that the individual’s experience of free
will is severely limited by the ‘principalities and powers’ of the unconscious psyche:
Each of us is equipped with a psychic disposition that limits our freedom in
high degree and makes it practically illusory . . . We do not enjoy masterless freedom; we are continually threatened by psychic factors which, in the
guise of ‘natural phenomena’, may take possession of us at any moment . . .
‘Principalities and powers’ are always with us; we have no need to create them
even if we could.32
Much later in his life, in an interview given to The Daily Mail, Jung expressed his
understanding of the unity of fate and psyche, echoing Novalis’ declaration that
‘fate and soul are but two names for the same principle’ by stating:33
What happens to a person is characteristic of him. He represents a pattern
and all the pieces fit. One by one, as his life proceeds, they fall into place
according to some predestined design.34



‘The great fate’

123

Fate and soul, as presented in Liber Novus, are indeed two different names for a
single principle. Addressing his Soul, Jung declared:
You took away where I thought to take hold, and you gave me where I did
not expect anything and time and again you brought about fate from new
and unexpected quarters.35
Jung also equated fate with the Self, the goal of the individuation process, ‘because
it is the most complete expression of that fateful combination we call individuality’.36 What happens to any individual – excluding those experiences that are part
of the ‘fate of the peoples’ and can subsume individual unfoldment37 – is therefore a reflection of this mysterious inner process, which can only be transformed
(although neither avoided nor eradicated) through consciousness. ‘If we do not see
a thing’, Jung commented in one of his ETH lectures, ‘Fate does it to us’.38

The Stoic Heimarmene
Jung seems to have adopted some of his ideas about fate from the Stoics, in particular the concept of Heimarmene, which he described as ‘the compulsion of the
stars’.39 He also defined Heimarmene as ‘the dependence of character and destiny on
certain moments in time’.40 The term ‘destiny’ is subtly different from the idea of
fate as either karmic retribution or pathological compulsion, and suggests something more akin to Neoplatonic ideas of the teleological nature of the personal
daimon. Fate is not only astral compulsion, but also astral teleology: the broad
outline of the path or personal myth an individual must follow in life in order to
fulfil the requirements of the soul and, ultimately, the intelligent design of the ‘Primal Light’ or ‘Primal Fire’, the universal deity of Stoic philosophy.41 Jung’s various references to Heimarmene in the Collected Works reveal a fascination with this
ancient Stoic idea of celestial fate, which he articulated in psychological language
in his various analogies between the planetary configurations, the complexes of
the unconscious, and the archetypal patterns that constitute the meaningful fate
of the individual.
Stoicism emerged in the third century bce, and exercised an enormous influence on the philosophy and practice of astrology for many centuries.42 The Stoic
Heimarmene may be understood as both ‘fate’ in the broadest sense, and ‘compulsion
by the stars’ in a specifically astrological sense. The word Heimarmene is derived
from the same root as Moira, the Greek word for ‘allotment’ and also the name of
the goddess of Fate. In the Orphic Derveni Papyrus, Moira represents the wisdom of
Zeus permeating all manifest creation; this wisdom or ‘breath’ (pneuma) of the god
is presented as the ‘allotment’ or essential purpose of each individual thing within
the whole.
Orpheus named this [divine] breath Moira . . . For before Zeus received his
name, Moira was the wisdom of the god always and through everything.43



124 ‘The great fate’

Heimarmene encompasses the thread of genetic inheritance that passes from generation to generation and provides the underlying template for each species of living
thing. But genetic inheritance determines the physiological aspect of the template.
Jung seems to have been more concerned with the psychological aspect – the
archetypes – and with the acausal or synchronistic nature of astral Heimarmene as
a reflection of sumpatheia. The Stoics understood God as the fiery, animating lifeforce behind all creation.44 Heimarmene in this context is not the ‘evil compulsion of
the star’, but is indistinguishable from Pronoia or Providence: divine will or intent.
The Stoic philosopher Poseidonius, discussed earlier in Chapter 3, referred to this
life-force as the ‘intellectual fiery breath of the cosmos’.45 Echoing the ancient
Orphic idea of Moira as the divine breath of Zeus, Poseidonius declared: ‘God is the
intellectual breath diffused throughout all matter’.46
In Psychological Types, Jung compared this Stoic divine fiery breath with the
Hindu concept of rta, the source of all cosmic energy. He then equated rta with
Heimarmene. Fate, astral compulsion, divine will, and the fiery cosmic libido are different ways of describing the same matrix of life:
It [rta] is, therefore, a kind of philosophical libido-symbol that can be directly
compared with the Stoic concept of heimarmene. For the Stoics heimarmene had
the significance of creative, primal heat, and at the same time it was a predetermined, regular process (hence its other meaning:‘compulsion of the stars’).47
Jung suggested that this ‘predetermined, regular process’ is experienced in the human
psyche through the spontaneous generation of archetypal images, symbolised by the
‘planetary gods’. These images are the self-portraits of the libido in its cyclical movement. The process of transforming ‘raw libido’ (concupiscentia, which Jung equated
with Heimarmene)48 into symbolic images is not due to any deliberate effort on the
part of consciousness, but is inherent in the libido itself, and ‘derives from a spiritual
source: in other words, the determining factor is the numinous primordial images’.49
Thus the unconscious itself seeks consciousness through the medium of the symbol,
which alone can provide the bridge between individual and universal: an idea which
Iamblichus articulated a millennium and a half before Jung did.
According to Jung, the ‘primordial images’ are also fate:
These fantasies are primarily self-representations of energic transformation
processes, which follow their specific laws and keep to a definite ‘path’ . . .
This path is also fate, in so far as a man’s fate depends on his psychology. It is
the path of our destiny and of the law of our being.50
Moreover, the experience of fate as inner compulsion can be understood as magical:
Magic exercises a compulsion that prevails over the conscious mind and will
of the victim: an alien will rises up in the bewitched and proves stronger than



‘The great fate’

125

his ego. The only comparable effect capable of psychological verification
is that exerted by unconscious contents, which by their compelling power
demonstrate their affinity with or dependence on man’s totality, that is, the
self and its ‘karmic’ functions.51
The intimate relationship between magic, inner compulsion, and the predetermined journey of the soul is made clear in Liber Novus, particularly in Jung’s dialogues with his Soul and with Philemon. In these various connections between fate,
astral compulsion, magic, libido, and the collective unconscious, Jung’s profound
and unorthodox understanding of astrology begins to emerge more clearly, as does
the manner in which he translated Theosophical ideas such as ‘karma’ into psychological concepts. Astrological images are ‘projections’ generated by the unconscious
human psyche onto the heavens. But these symbols, according to Ernst Gombrich’s
still relevant definition, unite ‘mystic significance and magic effect’.52 They portray
the innate qualities of time, which unfolds through a cyclical, orderly, and ‘predetermined’ process initiated by the archetypes themselves and experienced by the
human being as fate. As a psychologist concerned with individual development,
Jung made many references to the ways in which an individual can allow his or her
‘untamed’, unconscious libido ‘to get stuck in a childish milieu’, resulting in the
compulsive recreation of the original parental relationships.53 In Jung’s approach
to Heimarmene, the value of careful clinical work was never underestimated. But
behind the suffering patient lies the greater realm of the collective unconscious
with its ‘eternal images’ – which, like the gods in Iamblichus’ De mysteriis, seek their
own transformation through the medium of the individual psyche.
The fabric of the universe, in Stoic philosophy, is simultaneously spiritual and
material, a union of opposites that Jung encapsulated in his concept of the ‘psychoid’ unconscious.54 Jung may have derived the term ‘psychoid’ from Eugen
Bleuler, but it seems that the Stoics had the idea two millennia earlier. This Stoic
psycho-physical universe is itself the essence of deity; there is no transcendent god
‘outside’ the Stoic system. It is often described in late antique texts as a web, or a
cloth woven of twisted threads spun by the three Moirai.55 In Apuleius’ Metamorphoses, a work Jung seems to have been particularly fond of, Lucius, in his prayer to
Isis, Queen of Heaven, refers to her saving hand,
by which thou dost unravel the inextricably entangled threads of the fates,
and dost assuage the tempests of fortune and restrain the malignant influences
of the stars.56
Although Lucius understood astral influences as ‘malignant’, this view was not
always shared by other authors, nor by Jung himself; the anti-cosmic feelings displayed in this passage of Metamorphoses represent only one perspective in an ongoing discourse in antiquity about the nature of astral fate. Sometimes Heimarmene
was envisaged as a chain under the guardianship of divine providence. The Roman



126 ‘The great fate’

Stoic philosopher, politician, and dramatist Seneca (4 bce–65 ce), another author
Jung seems to have favoured, declared:57
We are all fastened to fortune. In the case of some the chain is of gold and
extended, with others it is short and mean. But what does it matter? The
same guardianship has enveloped all; those who have strung the cable are
themselves attached . . . All life is dependence.58
The image of Heimarmene as a web, chain, tangle of threads, or woven cloth was
taken up by later writers such as the eighteenth-century Swiss jurist and anthropologist Johann Jacob Bachofen (1815–1887), whose best-known work, Das Mutterrecht, was of considerable interest to Jung.59 According to Bachofen,
The web of tellurian creation becomes the web of destiny, the thread becomes
the carrier of human fate . . . The loom, carrier of the supreme law of creation written in the stars, was assigned to the uranian deities in their sidereal
nature . . . human life and the entire cosmos were seen as a great web of
destiny.60
This motif of the spinning of the cloth of fate appears in Liber Novus. Jung, referring
to the fateful power of the ‘spirit of the depths’, declared:
Lost and swallowed by the streams of procreating life, we approach the overpowering, inhuman forces that are busily creating what is to come. How
much future the depths carry! Are not the threads spun down there over
millennia?61
The metaphor has also been used by Jungians such as Erich Neumann (1905–60),
who described ‘the primordial mystery of weaving and spinning’ in relation to the
archetype of the Great Mother, who ‘weaves the web of life and spins the thread
of fate’:
It is not by accident that we speak of the body’s tissues, for the tissue woven
by the Feminine in the cosmos and in the uterus of woman is life and destiny.
And astrology, the study of a destiny governed by the stars, teaches that both
begin at once, at the temporal moment of birth.62
The threads of fate are the same as the planetary compulsions, since the universe,
to the Stoics, was a living thing, emanating from and infused with the ‘Artificer’s
Fire’, generating everything and forming the essence of both Pronoia (divine intent)
and Heimarmene (astral fate), itself the embodiment of Pronoia expressed through
the cycles of time.63
Although different Stoics approached the paradox of fate and free will with different arguments that evolved over time, the central question remained: what kind



‘The great fate’

127

of universe do humans inhabit, and how can they learn to live in it harmoniously?
The Stoically inclined Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, another author whose
work Jung acquired, phrased the options eloquently in the second century ce:64
The universe must be governed either by a fore-ordained destiny – an order
that no one may step beyond, or by a merciful providence, or by a chaos of
chance devoid of a ruler.65
If the universe is entirely fated by an impersonal power, then choice cannot exist,
for good or for evil. But if God is good and, as Marcus Aurelius suggested, divine
providence ‘watches over all’, the individual can exercise free will and consciously
choose to align himself or herself with Pronoia, struggling against evil irrational
impulses, even if the struggle ultimately fails.
Jung seems to have understood this conundrum as the dilemma of individual
character responding to events in accord with its own unique nature. An event
might be ‘predetermined’ by the compulsions of a complex and ‘attracted’ by the
law of sumpatheia, understood as the ‘psychoid’ expression of the archetype. But
the individual’s response depends on inherent character. Like the woven cloth of
Heimarmene, inherent character is complex, comprised not only of conscious values
and unconscious complexes underpinned by archetypal patterns, but also those
values and complexes arising from family, ancestors, and culture long before the
individual’s birth. Although one might be compelled by unconscious compulsion
to perform actions against one’s wishes, one can, with the help of increased consciousness, strive to understand and avoid the destructive act. Jung referred to the
configuration of Moon square Mercury in Miss X’s horoscope as ‘danger’ rather
than a preordained fate. In his view there is room for a limited degree of free will,
arising from a dialectic between conscious and unconscious. Jung clearly found
it difficult to reject the sense of fate at work in his own and others’ lives. But his
concept of individuation – the evolution of the personality into what it was always
‘fated’ to become – may be understood as an effort to reconcile the paradox that
plagued the Stoics for so many centuries. Jung’s solution was both succinct and
elegant:
Free will is doing gladly and freely that which one must do.66

The Gnostic Heimarmene
In recent years there has been considerable scholarly discussion about Jung’s socalled Gnostic propensities.67 Richard Noll, viewing every aspect of Jung’s ideas
in the context of his assumption that Jung was attempting to found a solar cult,
declares: ‘By 1916 Jung began to link his self-identity and personal destiny with
Gnosticism’.68 Lance Owen asserts something similar, although without the hostile
personal agenda: ‘At the very beginning of his journey, Jung most closely associated his experience with Gnosticism’.69 Even the ring Jung wore – a purportedly



128 ‘The great fate’

‘Gnostic’ ring bearing ‘an ancient motif ’ and inscribed with the word ‘Abraxas’70 –
suggests a personal identification with this late antique religious current.
Jung’s own assertion that Gnostic ideas, surviving in the alchemy of the medieval
and early modern periods, were the predecessors of his own psychological theories,
has added to the scholarly assumption of the ‘Gnostic’ Jung.71 So has the pseudonym ‘Basilides’, based on an Alexandrian Gnostic teacher of the second century
ce, which Jung utilised in the published version of ‘Scrutinies’ that he titled Septem
sermones ad mortuos.72 Certain Gnostic concepts also found their way into the text of
‘Scrutinies’, and appear in the cosmological diagram Jung called Systema Munditotius or ‘System of All Worlds’.73 But ‘Gnosticism’, if it was ever an ‘ism’, has proven
exceedingly difficult to confine to a discrete, homogenous category. If attempting
to define magic is a ‘maddening task’,74 attempting to define ‘Gnosticism’ generates
a similar sort of confusion. Jung’s highly individual interpretation of the Gnostics,
based on the limited sources available to him in the first decades of the twentieth
century and filtered through the lens of his psychological understanding, differed
radically from the increasingly culture-specific perspectives of many scholars today.
Literature on the Gnostics, scholarly and otherwise, is vast, and a bibliography could easily fill hundreds of volumes. The series of monographs on Gnostic
texts titled Nag Hammadi and Manichaean Studies, published by Brill, has already
reached nearly ninety volumes and is still growing.75 Much of this literature has
attempted to clarify whether the Gnostic movement originated with Christians,
Jews, or pagans; which Gnostic ‘system’ was the ‘true’ exemplar of this religious
current; and whether Gnostic mythic cosmologies were rooted in Platonic, Hermetic, Zoroastrian, or Abrahamic soil, or a combination of all of them. Concepts
often attributed to Gnostic groups, such as ‘dualism’ – the stark distinction between
a ‘good’ transcendent deity and an ‘evil’ material world – are often simplistic, and
depend on which Gnostic text or teacher is being investigated. Likewise, the idea
that all Gnostics were ‘heretical’ Christians, or even Christian at all, is problematic;
there were Gnostic currents within Judaism, and some Gnostics were not affiliated
with Christianity in any form.76 Moreover, ‘heresy’ is a religious category, not an
historical one; and it may not even be possible any longer, given the increasing
sophistication of scholarly research, to define any ‘mainstream’ Christianity of the
second century ce against which Gnostic currents can be contrasted.77
Robert Segal, attempting to answer the question of whether Jung was a Gnostic, describes Gnosticism as ‘the belief in an antithetical dualism of immateriality, which is good, and matter, which is evil’.78 But Gnostic currents were never
homogenously ‘dualistic’. Even when it is clear that a particular text posits such a
polarity between spirit and matter, material reality is not necessarily viewed as evil.
The polarity was described by Plato, who did not understand material existence as
evil, but perceived it as the emanation of the World Soul, whose divine nature, in
contrast to its fluctuating reflections in the natural world, requires a different kind
of consciousness to perceive.79 The influence of Plato’s benign vision of material
reality on many Gnostic texts was even noted by the Christian heresiologists Irenaeus and Hippolytus, as well as by Plotinus, in late antiquity.80



‘The great fate’

129

At one end of the Gnostic spectrum is the ferociously anti-cosmic polemic
of the Manichaean movement, which promulgated the idea of two eternal and
irreconcilable cosmic powers: the heavenly realm of light and the earthly realm
of darkness.81 At the other end of the spectrum is the pro-cosmic approach of the
Platonising Gnostics. The treatise known as Marsanes, for example, declared:
I have deliberated and have attained to the boundary of the sense-perceptible
world. (I have come to know) part by part the entire place of the incorporeal
being, and (I) have come to know the intelligible world. (I have come to
know), when I was deliberating, that in every respect the sense-perceptible
world is (worthy) of being saved entirely.82
Jung’s psychological models invariably espouse a goal of integration rather than
transcendence, perfection, or repudiation of material reality. As a result of the transformations occurring through a direct encounter between consciousness and the
archetypal dominants of the unconscious, the individual ‘approaches wholeness but
not perfection’:83
There is a considerable difference between perfection and completeness . . . Where
the archetype predominates, completeness is forced upon us against all our
conscious strivings . . . The individual may strive after perfection . . . but must
suffer from the opposite of his intentions for the sake of his completeness.84
This statement suggests that, although Jung perceived psyche and matter as two
poles of a spectrum, he was not sympathetic to more radical Gnostic ideas of an
irreconcilable division of corrupt body and incorruptible spirit. Nor does Jung’s
astrology reflect the Gnostic idea of the ‘evil’ nature of the planetary archons.
Jung understood the grand cosmological dramas of Gnostic myths to be imaginal
portrayals of unconscious human psychological processes. He declared that ‘the
idea of an unconscious was not unknown to them [the Gnostics]’,85 and that the
Gnostic celestial anthropos or ‘Original Man’ – a cosmic redeemer-figure and,
at the same time, the spark of divinity in every human being – ‘expresses the
presence of a transconscious centre which . . . must be regarded as a symbol of
wholeness’.86
There is no ‘essential’ or ‘typical’ Gnostic work against which all others can
be compared.87 Simple views of the Gnostic ‘heresy’ changed radically from the
mid-twentieth century onward, once the discovery in 1945 of the extraordinary
cache of Gnostic and Hermetic texts at Nag Hammadi in Egypt had transformed
earlier perceptions based on Christian heresiologists such as Irenaeus, Hippolytus,
and Epiphanius.88 But even in today’s scholarly works, the astrological nature of
Gnostic cosmology is not explored in any depth. Jung had to rely on the heresiologists and the limited number of Gnostic treatises translated by Mead,89 as well
as on early researchers such as Wilhelm Bousset and Richard Reitzenstein, whose
work reflected the academic and religious fashions of their time.90 And Mead’s view



130 ‘The great fate’

of the Gnostics was filtered through a Theosophical lens, just as the views of the
heresiologists were filtered through the lens of their understanding of ‘true’ Christianity. Jung’s own elision of Gnostic, Hermetic, and Mithraic currents, evident in
Psychology of the Unconscious as well as in Liber Novus, seems to be based in part on
these sources. But perhaps more importantly, he expressed his personal understanding of the Greek word gnosis, which does not necessarily accord with either older
or current scholarly definitions. Jung’s focus, as always, was on gnosis as a direct psychological experience of that ‘matrix and organizing principle of consciousness’,91
the archetype of the Self.

Saturn and Abraxas
In the many discussions about Jung’s Gnostic predilections, the astrological core
present in virtually every Gnostic treatise, to which Jung paid careful attention in
his various discussions about fate, has been largely overlooked. According to Jung,
astral fate or Heimarmene was central to both Gnostic texts and alchemy, and both
currents were concerned with breaking the chains of fate by a mythic journey of
the soul through seven stages or spheres. In Gnostic treatises, this ascent is planetary
and celestial; in alchemical writings, it is planetary and metallurgical. Citing the
third-century alchemist Zosimos, Jung referred to the Anthropos or ‘Son of God’
as a ‘Gnostic Christ’, and stated:
As in later Christian alchemy, the Son of God is a sort of paradigm of sublimation, i.e., of the freeing of the soul from the grip of Heimarmene.92
For Jung, alchemy was gnosis projected onto the seven planetary metals of the
earth, rather than onto the seven planetary archons of the celestial world.93
In his discussion of an early medieval alchemical text, Jung described a ‘crown
of victory’ awarded by Hermes:
This refers to the synthesis of the planets or metals with the sun, to form a
crown which will be ‘within’ Hermes. The crown signifies the kingly totality; it stands for unity and is not subject to Heimarmene. This reminds us of
the seven- or twelve-rayed crown of light which the Agathodaimon serpent
wears on Gnostic gems.94
This ‘crown of victory’, which is not susceptible to astral fate, belongs to the
individual who has managed to integrate into consciousness the archetypal patterns
inherent in the complexes of the unconscious, and who has thus become free from
astral compulsion:
Anyone who has passed through all the [planetary] spheres is free from compulsion; he has won the crown of victory and become like a god.95



‘The great fate’

131

In Book II of Liber Novus, the crown is given by the Serpent to Jung as he
hangs on the cross ‘between sky and earth’, undergoing that suffering which
must inevitably accompany any effort at psychic integration.96 The crown is
also the alchemical prima materia or ‘primal substance’, the raw unconscious
libido that contains the hidden spark of divinity, and which Jung described as
belonging to Saturn. It is ‘the most despised and rejected thing, thrown out
into the street’; the more the conscious ego is ‘bound by time and space’, the
more this hidden daimon feels like fate.97 In these associations, Jung presented
his understanding that the symbolism of the Gnostic ascent of the soul, which
ultimately breaks the inner compulsion of astral Heimarmene through a direct
encounter with the transpersonal centre of the personality, must begin with the
unconscious darkness within the human being: that which is most despised and
‘inferior’, which Jung defined astrologically as Saturn. The highest and most
obstructive of the Gnostic planetary archons, called Ialdabaoth, is ‘identical
with Saturn’.98 But for Jung, this archon was not evil; he secretly contains the
unknown, unconscious Self.
In the late antique iconography of magical amulets, the solar crown was worn
by the serpent-bodied, lion-headed deity Chnoumis (see Plate 3), and Jung’s own
‘Gnostic’ ring, according to his own description, displays a typical late antique GrecoEgyptian carving of this solar cosmocrator.99 Jung tended to conflate Chnoumis
with the so-called Gnostic deity Abraxas. But Abraxas was not exclusively Gnostic;
rather, the name is a magical ‘Name of Power’ associated with several deities in the
syncretic milieux of late antiquity, including Chnoumis. The cock-headed, serpentlegged being who appears on so many late antique amulets, sometimes assumed
to be Abraxas, is usually designated by the name IAO, the Greek transliteration of
the Hebrew YHVH.100 Jung, following the scholarly research of the time, assumed
both these figures to be Gnostic.101 But he also understood Abraxas as a symbol of
the libido in its annual solar cycle, representing ‘fullness and emptiness, generation
and destruction’:102
The Gnostic symbol Abraxas, a made-up name meaning three hundred and
sixty-five . . . the Gnostics used it as the name of their supreme deity. He was
a time god. The philosophy of Bergson, la durée créatrice, is an expression of
the same idea.103
Jung expanded further on this perception of Abraxas as a libido-symbol – symbolised
astrologically by both Saturn as the matrix and the Sun as the light born from it – in
the Visions Seminars:
That figure of Abraxas means the beginning and the end, it is life and death,
therefore it is represented by a monstrous figure. It is a monster because it
is the life of vegetation in the course of one year, the spring and the autumn,
the summer and the winter, the yea and nay of nature.104



132 ‘The great fate’

For Jung, Abraxas was a symbol of the collective unconscious in its cyclical movement, also portrayed by the symbolic circle of the zodiac as the pathway of the Sun
in its yearly round. Abraxas unites the darkness of Saturn’s earthly, mortal domain
with the immortal spiritual light of the Sun:
Comparison with the sun teaches us over and over again that the gods are
libido. It is that part of us which is immortal . . . Its springs, which well up
from the depths of the unconscious, come, as does our life in general, from
the root of the whole of humanity . . . The divine in us is the libido.105
Abraxas is both the demiurgos or ‘world-creator’ and the libido as World Soul.106
Jung’s discourses on Gnostic Heimarmene do not reflect a personal belief in a dualistic cosmos animated by ontically independent and inimical planetary beings. They
describe a psychic process that he observed in human beings and called ‘individuation’, and for which he was convinced the astral ascent in the Gnostic treatises
provided one of the earliest and richest models.

G.R.S. Mead and Pistis Sophia
Between 1890 and 1891, G.R.S. Mead published, in the Theosophical journal
Lucifer, the first English translation of a Gnostic text of the second to third centuries
ce, known as Pistis Sophia. The translation, issued as a series of articles, was accompanied by commentaries by H.P. Blavatsky, who, predictably, attempted to correlate
Gnostic and Hindu concepts and claim that the former derived from the latter.107
The entire translation was published as a book in 1896, and in 1900 a summary of
the text was included in Mead’s lengthy exegesis of the Gnostics, Fragments of a Faith
Forgotten.108 Pistis Sophia is perhaps the most important of the Gnostic texts available
to Jung during the years he worked on Liber Novus. At the time, it alone existed as
a complete manuscript free of the interference of the Christian heresiologists, and
its elaborate cosmology is entirely astrological.109 So important to Jung was Mead’s
translation of Pistis Sophia that, according to Gilles Quispel, a good friend of Jung
and a respected scholar of Gnostic currents, Jung made a special journey to London
to thank Mead for the work.110
Although Mead never wrote a book on astrology, he was familiar with it through
his friendship with Alan Leo and the numerous astrological articles that Leo contributed to The Quest. Pistis Sophia employs astrological concepts and imagery as
the basis of its message: the Saviour-God or celestial Anthropos, sent from the
upper spiritual realms by his father Jeu,111 enters the ‘Fate-sphere’ of the seven
planetary archons and breaks ‘a third of their power’ by turning the cosmic pole
‘for the salvation of all souls’.112 This idea can be seen, translated into psychological
terms, in Jung’s insistence that the expanded consciousness resulting from a direct
individual experience of the Self, the ‘organizing principle of consciousness’, can,
at least partially, transform the compulsive expression of the archetypes that stand
behind complexes.



‘The great fate’

133

In the text of Pistis Sophia, the zodiacal constellations are called aeons:
And after these things, when the sphere turns . . . the Good, he of the Midst,
who is called Zeus [Jupiter] in the world, comes; and he comes to the eighth
aeon which is called Scorpion. And Bubastis, who is called Aphrodite [Venus],
comes, and she comes to the second aeon of the sphere which is called the
Bull. Then the veils which are between those of the left and those of the right
are drawn aside.113
The word ‘aeon’ (also spelled ‘aion’) is rarely used in modern astrological works as
a synonym for a zodiacal sign or constellation. But Jung’s application of the term
to describe an astrological ‘age’, or 2,165-year segment of the great cycle of equinoctial precession through the zodiacal constellations, is very specific, as we will see
in the next chapter, and his concept of the approaching new aion of Aquarius was
clearly influenced by Pistis Sophia.114
Fate appears in the text of Pistis Sophia as the allotment of the span of a human life:
And also the destiny, whose name is Moira, leadeth the man until it hath him
slain through the death appointed unto him.115
Pistis Sophia also uses the term Heimarmene. However ‘the great Fate’, as it is called,
does not concern predetermined external events such as wealth, poverty, illness,
marriage, or length of life. Imposed by the planetary archons, it is expressed as individual suffering in the face of an overwhelming compulsion to sin:
All men who shall receive the mysteries of the Ineffable and moreover the
mysteries of the First Mystery, sin every time through the compulsion of the Fate.116
The idea of fate as inner compulsion appears in the much earlier Orphic fragments,
which describe the ‘circle of wearying heavy grief ’ – the zodiacal constellations – as
an interior experience of compulsive, repetitive suffering.117 The idea that a certain
type of gnosis – the recollection or rediscovery of one’s divine origin – can free
the soul from the compulsive inner torment of astral fate can also be found in the
Hermetica, where the zodiacal constellations ‘torture the inward person with the sufferings of sense’.118 Gnostic and Hermetic currents, like Platonic philosophy, owed
a great deal to Orphic conceptions; Jung was not mistaken in perceiving parallels
between them.119 Nor, it seems, was he mistaken in understanding these interiorised
astrological portrayals as ‘the sum of all the psychological knowledge of antiquity’.120

Mead and Jung
Mead’s knowledge of Gnostic texts was immensely useful to Jung, and Jung’s own
interpretations of Gnostic cosmology might therefore be assumed to be Theosophical.121 But it is more likely that the importance of Mead’s translations and



134 ‘The great fate’

commentaries for Jung lay, not in any specific system of beliefs imposed on the
material, but in the vitality and intuitive insight that Mead brought to his work.
Like Thomas Taylor a century earlier, Mead was personally sympathetic to the
most important aspects of the world-view presented in Hermetic, Neoplatonic, and
Gnostic writings; and this genuine love of and receptivity to the material and its
poetic mode of expression was not typical of the offerings of the German scholars
of Jung’s time, however accurate and thorough their translations might be. Mead
made his materials come alive in ways that may perhaps be insufficiently appreciated in the context of today’s scholarship; and for Jung these materials were already
alive, filled with visions and ideas that were immediately recognisable to him as
characteristic expressions of the human psyche.
Jung was not a card-carrying Theosophist in any doctrinal sense, any more than
he was a card-carrying Gnostic. His ongoing interest in Theosophical literature,
reflected by the presence of a number of seminal Theosophical works in his private
library, was balanced by a profound distaste for what he viewed as the Theosophists’
serious lack of psychological awareness.122 A number of Theosophical concepts,
such as the ‘central spiritual Sun’, were attractive to him when interpreted within a
psychological framework; but the idea of the noetic Sun can be found in the various Platonic, Neoplatonic, and Hermetic currents of late antiquity, which, as Jung
was well aware, Blavatsky had adapted for her own purposes. Where Blavatsky saw
these enduring ideas as indications of the secret transmission of a primal wisdomreligion of which she herself was the latest recipient, Jung saw them as archetypal.
Jung never underestimated the collective appeal of Theosophy’s ‘pseudo-­Gnostic
intuitions’,123 viewing them as the inevitable, if dangerously misguided, eruption of
an unconscious collective need for counteracting the extreme materialism of the
‘spirit of this time’.124 But he saw Theosophical doctrines as a ‘primitive projection of psychological factors’,125 full of ‘pompous jargon’,126 and comparable with
the determined dogmatism of Freud, which, Jung felt, ‘comes very close to the
attitude of religious conviction that characterizes these movements [Theosophy
and Christian Science]’.127 Mead, although he had served as private secretary to
Blavatsky from 1884 to 1891 and continued his membership in the Theosophical
Society until 1909, was, by the time Jung met him, as sceptical of the organisation
and its ideology as Jung was. Mead joined the Theosophical Society when he was
twenty-one years old, fresh from completing a degree in Classics at Cambridge, but
by the time of Blavatsky’s death in 1891 he had already outgrown her influence, if
he was ever entirely under it:
I had never, even while a member, preached the Mahatma-gospel of H.P.
Blavatsky, or propagandized Neo-theosophy and its revelations. I had believed
that ‘theosophy’ proper meant the wisdom-element in the great religions and
philosophies of the world.128
Mead parted ways with the Theosophists in 1909, along with seven hundred other
members of the Society, due to the sexual scandal surrounding a prominent member, C.W. Leadbeater, between 1906 and 1908.129 But Mead had deeper ongoing



‘The great fate’

135

problems with the Society, not least with its assumption of blind obedience to
Blavatsky’s spiritual ‘Masters’ and those who claimed to channel their wisdom. For
many years he had been drawn to the traditions of Gnostic and Hermetic currents, rather than to the doctrines of the East which Blavatsky and her politically
ambitious successors assiduously promulgated. Mead had the temperament of a
scholar rather than a disciple, and could not tolerate the Society’s ‘innumerable
dogmatic assertions, its crooked methods and reprehensible proceedings’, which he
felt marred the goals and ethics of the Society.130
Mead was probably the finest scholar of ancient religions the British occult
revival produced, and it is easy to see why his learning, independent spirit, and
inspired translations appealed to Jung. Several authors have noted Mead’s impact
on Jung, partly based on the eighteen volumes of Mead’s work found in Jung’s
private library, and partly because of the number of references to Mead’s books
in Jung’s Psychology of the Unconscious. Mead was certainly an inspiration for Jung’s
understanding of the religious currents of late antiquity throughout the period
Jung worked on Liber Novus; but Jung was entirely capable of developing his own
psychological interpretations independent of any Theosophical ‘influence’.
Richard Noll has commented that Mead’s influence on Jung is ‘still unacknowledged’, and that ‘documents concerning the nature of their personal relationship
have not yet come to light’.131 But Mead’s importance has been acknowledged for
some time by a number of Jung scholars. And one letter has ‘come to light’, from
Mead to Jung, dated 19 November 1919.132 It is clear from the rather gossipy content of the letter that the two men had met just prior to its writing, and had enjoyed
more than one meeting in the past.133 Their relationship was that of friends and
equals, rather than of mentor and disciple, and they enjoyed talking about books
and their authors. In the letter, Mead mentioned an author they had apparently
been discussing at their previous meeting: the Austrian novelist Gustav Meyrink
(1868–1932). Meyrink, who was of great interest to Jung,134 was a major player on
the European occult ‘scene’ in the first decades of the twentieth century. He had
been initiated into the Order of the Golden Dawn in 1889, a year after its creation,
and had also founded the ‘Blue Star’ Theosophical Lodge in Prague in 1891.135 Jung
had assumed that Meyrink’s ‘occult’ novel, Der Golem, published in 1915, was a piece
of inspirational or ‘automatic’ writing, a spontaneous product of the unconscious
similar to his own Septem sermones ad mortuos. Mead corrected this assumption by
declaring that Meyrink had in fact laboured for many years to produce Der Golem.
In his letter, Mead also recommended to Jung the writings of Robert Eisler
(1882–1949), a Jewish historian of ancient mystery religions and of astrology, who
had contributed articles to Mead’s journal, The Quest, before the Great War, and
whose prolific work Jung later assiduously collected for his own library.136 It is
likely that Mead arranged an introduction between the two men. Jung used the
image of a bas-relief of the primal god Phanes – identified by Eisler as Orphic
and thus contradicting Franz Cumont’s assumption of its Mithraic origin – as the
frontispiece for Aion, citing Eisler’s authority as his source.137 Eisler, in turn, wrote
a work on the history and psychology of lycanthropy that included an appendix
supporting Jung’s theory of the archetypes and the collective unconscious.138



136 ‘The great fate’

Clare and Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, in their biography of Mead, have asserted
that Mead’s focus on complex chains of symbolic correspondences, linking ‘states
of divine being and inner states of consciousness’, became Mead’s ‘major legacy to
Carl Gustav Jung and his psychoanalytical theory’.139 Although Jung had already
encountered this psycho-cosmological model in the writings of the Neoplatonists and Hermeticists, there is no doubt that Mead’s enthusiastic articulation of the
ideas in modern language appealed to him. Mead’s translations included two other
books that proved relevant to Jung’s work on both Psychology of the Unconscious and
Liber Novus. These were A Mithraic Ritual, based on a late antique text originally
titled Eine Mithrasliturgie by its German editor and translator, Albrecht Dieterich;140
and The Mysteries of Mithra, which included Mead’s translated fragments of various
late antique writings describing the Mithraic cult.141 The so-called Mithras Liturgy is
neither Gnostic nor Mithraic.142 It refers to itself as a ‘Ritual of Immortalisation’,143
and is, in fact, a theurgic ritual aimed at individual transformation through a direct
experience of the central spiritual Sun, called Helios-Mithras. The Mithras Liturgy
has more in common with Hermetic treatises than with the Mithraic ‘mysteries’,144 a
fact of which Jung was well aware, as he had acquired Franz Cumont’s translation of
the text as well as another work by Cumont in which the Belgian archaeologist and
religious historian discounted any relationship between the Liturgy and Mithraism.145
Not surprisingly, this theurgic ritual relies on an astrological framework. Along with
the Orphic Hymns, the Mithras Liturgy seems to have provided inspiration for Jung’s
own theurgic hymns to the Sun and to Phanes in Liber Novus and the Black Books.
Mead’s understanding of gnosis, which allowed him to include texts such as the
Mithras Liturgy under its umbrella, was not limited to the anti-cosmic dualism often
associated with Gnostic currents in late antiquity. He perceived the experience
of gnosis as a union of all opposites, synthesising intellect and emotion, male and
female, and the individual with the ‘All Self ’:146
If I believe rightly, the very essence of Gnosis is the faith that man can transcend the limits of the duality that makes him man, and become a consciously
divine being.147
Mead equated astral fate with ‘karma’, as it was called in Theosophical literature: the
astrological configurations at birth reflect not only the individual’s pattern of unfoldment, but also the fruits of choices made in former incarnations.148 But the power of
the planets is only partial; ‘Nature’, or inherent genetic structure, also plays a part in
the individual’s unfoldment, along with free will. As Mead put it, each of these factors
‘re-acts on each, none is absolute’.149 It is unlikely that Jung would have disagreed.

Astral fate and the ‘subtle’ body
The idea of the ochêma pneuma or ‘spirit-vehicle’, known to the Theosophists as the
‘astral’ or ‘subtle body’, seems to have interested Jung deeply.150 He encountered the
idea in various sources, including Iamblichus, Proclus, Stoic physics,151 Gnostic texts



‘The great fate’

137

such as Apocryphon of John and Pistis Sophia, the Hermetica, the Tibetan Book of the
Dead,152 alchemical treatises, and the Christian corpus glorificationis: the incorruptible
‘subtle body’ given to the righteous after resurrection.153 Jung believed he had also
discovered the concept in the Native American tale of Hiawatha, who, in Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow’s poem, receives ‘a breath-body or subtle body not subject
to corruption’ as a reward for his victory over the Northwest Wind.154
Hiawatha’s ‘subtle body’ does not resemble the unpurified planetary ‘counterfeit
spirit’ of Gnostic texts, but seems to be the carrier of the divine spark in each individual, which Jung understood to be the Self. But these two perceptions – the ‘subtle body’ as an intermediary organ linking planets, soul, and body, and as a purified
spirit-vehicle free of mortal corruption – often overlapped, depending on whether
a particular author viewed the celestial bodies as evil or as emanations of the divine.
Jung understood the ‘subtle body’ to represent the interconnection between the
psyche and the material world, reflecting his concept of the psychoid nature of the
archetypes and the secret unity of spirit and matter:
In view of the intimate connection that exists between certain psychic processes and their physical parallels we cannot very well accept the total immateriality of the psyche . . . Spirit and matter may well be forms of one and the
same transcendental being.155
Mead produced a work on the ‘subtle body’ in 1919, which Jung later cited when
he suggested a parallel between this ‘psychoid’ intermediary and the unconscious
psyche.156 Mead’s book explored the ancient ‘ladder of ascent from the earth to
the light-world’ in Neoplatonism, Christian Gnosticism, Hermetic alchemy, and
the Mithras Liturgy. All these late antique religious approaches, according to Mead,
shared a concern with ‘the soul-freeing doctrine of regeneration’, which could
also be understood as the purification of the subtle body.157 Mead’s short volume seems to have contributed valuable insights to Jung’s equation of the soul’s
planetary ascent with the individuation process. Mead understood the ‘regeneration’ sought through theurgic rituals as the ‘bringing to birth of man’s perfected
subtle body’: an ‘inner transmutation and heightening of consciousness’ which
bears a close parallel to Jung’s idea of individuation.158 The purification of the
subtle body, as Jung described it later in relation to the alchemical process, is
the ­purification – or integration through the mediation of consciousness – of
the unconscious itself.
The mundificatio (purification) means . . . the removal of the superfluities
that always cling to merely natural products, and especially to the symbolic
unconscious contents which the alchemist found projected into matter . . .
The alchemist undertakes to produce a new, volatile (hence aerial or ‘spiritual’) entity endowed with corpus, anima, et spiritus, where corpus is naturally
understood as a ‘subtle’ body or ‘breath body’; the analyst tries to bring about
a certain attitude or frame of mind, a certain ‘spirit’ therefore.159



138 ‘The great fate’

The ultimate aim of alchemy, according to Jung, was ‘to produce a corpus subtile, a
transfigured and resurrected body’.160 These comments on the subtle body do not
refer directly to astrological factors, and Jung’s discussions of alchemy and the projection of unconscious contents on the alchemical metals were written long after
he had completed work on Liber Novus. But his remarks need to be understood in
the context of his assertion that ‘the gods of the metals should always be thought
of astrologically as well . . . The alchemical symbols are saturated with astrology’.161
The purified subtle body that provides the goal of the alchemical opus is not, after
all, so very different from the purified soul-vehicle of the Gnostics and Hermeticists, which sheds the compulsions of its planetary ‘appendages’ only when the
individual is transformed through gnosis.
The idea of the subtle body continued to preoccupy Jung over the years, especially as it was described by Galen and by alchemists such as Paracelsus (1493–
1541) and Martin Ruland (1569–1611). According to these authors, the subtle
body is not merely a ‘counterfeit spirit’ that generates evil desires, as described in
Pistis Sophia. Galen called the subtle body a ‘shining and aethereal’ body through
which the soul receives communion with the celestial bodies.162 In the early sixteenth century, Paracelsus, following Galen, understood the ‘shining’ body with its
planetary essences to be the intermediary between the human soul and the World
Soul or lumen naturae (‘light of Nature’);163 the lumen naturae is in turn the ‘“star”
in man’, and thus astrology is ‘a mother to all the other arts’.164 Martin Ruland,
following Paracelsus, equated the ‘shining’ body with the imagination, which he
called ‘the celestial or supercelestial body’.165 The influence of Iamblichus, direct or
indirect, on Paracelsus and Ruland is evident in this identification of the Neoplatonic phantasia with the subtle body as an intermediary between body and spirit,
supporting Jung’s conviction that active imagination was the optimum means
through which psychological transformations could be achieved. In alchemy, the
spirit Mercurius is the mysterious ‘volatile’ agent that precipitates both the material
transformation of the metals and the spiritual transformation of the alchemist.166
Mercurius, according to Jung, is itself the subtle body: the World Soul that seeks
its own transformation.167

Fate and compulsion
Heimarmene – the ‘compulsion of the stars’ – operates through the subtle body or,
in Jung’s understanding, ‘unconscious contents’: the complexes and their archetypal
foundations. Although Freud was not predisposed to discuss astrological factors
in relation to compulsion – at least not in print – nevertheless he used the term
‘daemonic force’ to describe the repetitive quality of unconscious compulsions and
their disturbing ‘otherness’:
The manifestations of a compulsion to repeat . . . exhibit to a high degree an
instinctual character and, when they act in opposition to the pleasure principle, give the appearance of some ‘daemonic’ force at work.168



‘The great fate’

139

Jung also had a great deal to say about compulsion, but unlike Freud – and unlike
the Gnostics – he did not view it as essentially pathological. He understood compulsiveness to be a quality inherent in all instinctual impulses, most of which, including
the instinct to individuate, are life-enhancing, although sometimes experienced
as inimical to conscious goals: ‘Compulsion is the unconscious wish’.169 Thus the
compulsions exerted by the subtle body – those pesky ‘unconscious contents’ – are
ultimately signs of meaning rather than of illness, and are generated by ‘man’s totality, that is, the self ’.170
Jung also understood compulsion as the sudden eruption of ‘conscience’, an
inner ‘moral reaction’ unfamiliar to the individual’s consciously adopted values:
The moral reaction is the outcome of an autonomous dynamism, fittingly
called man’s daemon, genius, guardian angel, better self, heart, inner voice, the
inner and higher man, and so forth. Close beside these, beside the positive,
‘right’ conscience, there stands the negative, ‘false’ conscience called the devil,
seducer, tempter, evil spirit, etc.171
It is this latter, ‘false’ conscience that Pistis Sophia seems to emphasise in the idea of
the planetary ‘counterfeit spirit’, which ‘contriveth and senseth all sins and the evil
which the rulers of the great Fate have commanded for the soul’.172 The Gnostic
teacher Basilides referred to the ‘counterfeit spirit’ as seven planetary ‘appendages’
that lure the soul into evil.173 This idea, stripped of its overt astrological cosmology,
has remained in Christian theology to the present day in the form of the Seven
Cardinal Sins, which seem to have begun their life as aspects of the soul’s descent
into incarnation via the hostile spheres of the planetary archons.174 In a religious
context in which instinctual desires were viewed as inherently evil, the suppressed
compulsions of the instincts, symbolised by the planets and zodiacal constellations,
would, in Jung’s view, inevitably be experienced as demonic;175 and the astrological
‘great Fate’ would be experienced as entirely malevolent. Although Jung learned a
great deal about Heimarmene from Pistis Sophia, it seems he found a more congenial
model of planetary compulsion in the world of the Hermetica.

The Hermetic Heimarmene
The earliest known examples of the body of late antique literature known as the
Hermetica date to the first century bce.176 Although most extant Hermetic texts
were produced later, they predate Gnostic currents as well as overlapping with them.
These texts were as fascinating to Jung as those of the Gnostics. The Hermetica, like
Gnostic treatises, emerged within the syncretic cultural matrix of Greco-Roman
Egypt,177 and are similarly concerned with astral fate, gnosis, individual transformation, and the eventual ‘bliss of the soul’.178 Some scholars consider the Hermetic
treatises to be Neoplatonic.179 Others view them as Gnostic, in the sense that some
of the texts – such as CH XIII, cited above – express a distinctly anti-cosmic worldview. In this treatise, the interior, compulsive nature of astral fate is clearly expressed.



140 ‘The great fate’

The mix of Gnostic and Hermetic materials found at Nag Hammadi suggests that
a vigorous interchange occurred between these two religious currents.180 The
defining characteristic of the Hermetica is that, unlike so many Gnostic treatises, no
Christian affiliation is displayed, although Jewish elements are evident in a number
of the texts.181 In the Hermetic world, the redeemer-figure is not Christ, but the
mythic semi-divine teacher of the ‘occult sciences’ of alchemy, astrology, and magic:
Hermes Trismegistus or ‘Thrice-Greatest Hermes’, also known by the name of his
divine Egyptian counterpart, the god Thoth.
The Hermetica have been discussed at length by many scholars, and the literature
on this extraordinary collection of texts has been growing since Marsilio Ficino
first translated fourteen of the treatises from Greek into Latin in 1471.182 By 1913,
when Jung began work on Liber Novus, he had collected virtually all of the scholarly works on the Hermetica available at the time.183 He often, and with good reason,
elided Hermetic and Gnostic ideas, referring to the third-century ce alchemist
Zosimos as both a Hermeticist and a Gnostic.184 Jung was convinced that both
currents were deeply psychological; both depended on individual revelation rather
than obedience to doctrine, and both involved theurgic rituals and an astrologically
based cosmology. Both currents also influenced the writings of Iamblichus and
Proclus. And both Hermeticists and Gnostics were preoccupied with freeing of the
soul from the bondage of the inner compulsions of astral Heimarmene.
Jung was familiar with the Hermetic texts through Marcellin Berthelot’s compilation, Collection des anciens alchemistes greques, published in 1887, and Mead’s English
translations of the corpus, published in 1906. He cited both authors in Psychology
of the Unconscious. Although he did not recognise the full psychological significance
of alchemy until several years after he had completed work on Liber Novus,185 the
Greco-Egyptian Hermetic materials were highly relevant to Jung’s early astrological and magical explorations. Their importance is indicated by their presence in
Liber Novus, where ‘the wisdom of ΕΡΜΗΣ ΤΡΙΣΜΕΓΙΣΤΥΣ [Hermes Trismegistus]’ is secreted in the cupboard of the magician Philemon.186 One of the most
important treatises in terms of Jung’s astrological understanding is CH I, known as
Poimandres.187 In this work, the liberation of the soul toward freedom from Heimarmene is presented as a journey through the planetary spheres to the divine realms
beyond. The soul is progressively purified of its seven ‘garments’ and ‘surrenders’
the vices of the seven planets. Finally, it enters the sublime eighth sphere of the
fixed stars.188 The object of the Hermetic ascent, like that of the Mithras Liturgy, is
the divinisation of the initiate. Poimandres echoes the words of one of the Orphic
gold funerary tablets, written some seven centuries earlier: ‘Out of a human, you
will become a god’.189 Hermetic initiation offered gnosis as a form of freedom from
the compulsions of astral fate.190 Although the planetary vices of Poimandres are
not intrinsically evil as are those portrayed in Pistis Sophia, each planet nevertheless
imposes a compulsion whose grip can be loosened only through theurgic ritual.191
Mead noted the echoes of the ascent of Poimandres in an influential fifthcentury ce work by the Roman author Macrobius, titled Commentary on the Dream
of Scipio – yet another work with which Jung was familiar, and which he cited in



‘The great fate’

141

Psychology of the Unconscious. But the planetary ‘vices’, in Macrobius’ hands, were
transformed into virtues; Macrobius described seven luminous ‘envelopes’ conveying positive attributes to the soul, such as the ‘bold spirit’ conferred by Mars.192
The spectrum of vices and virtues attached to each planet by the range of authors
described by Mead provided Jung with a rich psychological portrayal of astrological dynamics far more complex than the static descriptions of ‘benefic’ and ‘malefic’
planets inherited from Ptolemy.193 In Poimandres and the literature that it inspired,
both good and evil are presented as attributes of each planet, and the responsibility
for dealing with this polarity depends, not on the intervention of a redeemer-god
sent from celestial realms, but on the consciousness of the individual.
The technical astrology included in the Hermetica seems to have disturbed some
modern scholars, and the critical edition and translation of fifteen treatises by Sir
Walter Scott, published between 1924 and 1936, omitted most of this astrological
material because Scott deemed it to be ‘rubbish’.194 Like Gnostic literature in the
hands of the Christian heresiologists, the Hermetica in the hands of researchers such
as Scott have been seriously distorted by personal agendas. The texts were artificially divided by Scott and a French translator, the Dominican friar and philologist
André-Jean Festugière, into ‘higher’ or ‘philosophical’ Hermetica and ‘lower’, ‘popular’, or ‘magico-religious’ Hermetica.195 This arbitrary division, unlikely to have been
meaningful to the authors of the texts, reflects the discomfort generated in modern
times by confrontation with a late antique world in which magic, astrology, and
alchemy were an integral part of a highly sophisticated philosophical and religious
world-view. Many of the technical Hermetica mentioned in other late antique texts
have been lost;196 other texts still await modern critical editions and translations.197
However, the obvious astrological content of ‘philosophical’ Hermetica such as Poimandres was readily available to Jung through Mead’s translations.
According to one of these treatises, the ‘tent’ of the earthly body is formed as the
soul descends through the circle of the zodiac, rather than through the planetary
spheres. The body is thus subject to Heimarmene through the zodiacal signs.198 Hermeticists, like Gnostics, took up the idea of a subtle body through which planetary
and zodiacal influences operated. However, Heimarmene was not viewed as irrevocable; it could be overcome when kairos, the right astrological moment, arrived
and the spark of divinity could be theurgically ‘freed from its bodily prison and
thus removed from the control of fate’.199 The idea of an astrologically propitious
moment of time for confronting Heimarmene, described by both the Hermetica and
Iamblichus’ De mysteriis as well as the writings of Zosimos and various Gnostic texts,
suggests that Jung’s preoccupation with the movements occurring in his horoscope
at various times in his life – particularly in the late 1920s and early 1930s – reflects
not merely a concern about external events, but also a quest for the ‘right moment’
for some kind of inner breakthrough or illumination.200
Since the publication of Liber Novus, a number of astrologers have assessed the
transits and progressions in Jung’s horoscope to ascertain what was ‘happening’ to
him during the time he worked on the book.201 These analyses are often highly
insightful, but they do not address the question of whether some of the figures



142 ‘The great fate’

appearing in Liber Novus might have been deliberately invoked according to what a
Hermeticist would deem the astrologically appropriate moment. Sadly, no specific
instructions for finding that pregnant moment are given in the extant Hermetic
texts. But something resembling this type of astrological advice is offered by the
Mithras Liturgy, with which Jung was deeply familiar. Given his understanding of
astrological configurations as symbolic reflections of dynamic psychological processes, and his perception of the breaking of the chains of Heimarmene as an individual experience of the integration of unconscious archetypal potencies, it would
be surprising if he did not avail himself of the instructions offered by the Liturgy.
Jung seems to have viewed fate as an integral dimension of the individuation
process, and astrological symbolism as a reflection of the unfolding of that process.
The various currents of late antique religious thought that Jung was studying during the time he worked on Liber Novus present fate as intimately linked to the cyclical movements of the heavenly bodies, which Jung understood as symbols of the
archetypal dominants of the collective unconscious, expressing themselves through
the qualities of time. Fate, time, and the movements of the heavens are inextricably
bound up with Jung’s concept of individuation. Freedom from fate, in late antique
approaches, involved a form of gnosis or inner realisation that could break the
compulsions of the planetary daimons. There is no mention of altering external
circumstances through theurgic practices, since fate was understood as an interior
structure imposed on the soul during its time in incarnation. Freedom from Heimarmene required an alteration in consciousness, allowing the individual to be liberated from the compulsive actions that brought about suffering, and encouraging
the embrace of those dimensions of fate that reflected divine teleology. The matrix
of Orphic, Neoplatonic, Hermetic, and Gnostic thought, centred on an astrological
cosmology, seems to have provided Jung with a powerful form of hermeneutics to
help him interpret the spontaneous visions described in Liber Novus, as well as presenting a symbolic model of his most important psychological concept: that inner
process by which the individual becomes what he or she was always intended to be.

88 For these heresiologists, see Gérard Vallée, A Study in Anti-Gnostic Polemics (Waterloo,
ON: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1981). Jung possessed Latin and German versions
of Irenaeus: Irenaei episcopi lugdunensis contra omnes haereses (1702) and Des heiligen Irenäus
fünf Bücher gegen die Häresine (1912). He also acquired a German translation of Epiphanius, Ausgewählte Schriften (1919), and cites Hippolytus’ Elenchos regularly in Jung, CW9ii,
¶¶287–346.



146 ‘The great fate’

89 Mead published two collections on the Gnostics: Fragments of a Faith Forgotten (London:
Theosophical Publishing Society, 1900) and Echoes from the Gnosis (London: Theosophical Publishing Society, 1906–8). Jung acquired both collections soon after they
were published.
90 Wilhelm Bousset, Hauptprobleme der Gnosis (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht,
1907); Richard Reitzenstein, Poimandres (Leipzig: Teubner, 1904); Richard Reitzenstein, Mysterionreligionen nach ihren Grundgedanken und Wirkungen (Leipzig: Teubner,
1910). Jung cited all three works frequently in Psychology of the Unconscious.

93 For Jung’s discussion of this theme, see Jung, CW12, ¶461.
94 Jung, CW14, ¶6. The ‘Agathodaimon’ or ‘good daimon’ appears frequently on late
antique magical amulets; the seven-rayed crown suggests the planetary order, while the
twelve-rayed crown may be zodiacal.

p. 468. Photos of the ring appear on <http://gnosticwarrior.com/the-gnostic-ring-ofcarl-jung.html> and <http://gnosis.org/jung.ring.html>, but no reference is given for
these images.
100 For the syncretic nature of Abraxas, see Gilles Quispel, Gnostica, Judaica, Catholica, ed.
Johannes van Oort (Leiden: Brill, 2008), pp. 40–65, 243–60. Numerous late antique
gemstone amulets show the name Abraxas combined with the figure of Chnoumis. Jung
was familiar with many of these amulets through the illustrations in King, The Gnostics
and Their Remains. See Greene, The Astrological World of Jung’s ‘Liber Novus’, chapter 7.
101 See the editors’ comments in Jung, Liber Novus, p. 349, n. 93. Jung based much of his
understanding of Abraxas on Albrecht Dieterich’s Abraxas (Leipzig: Teubner, 1891);
he studied this work closely in 1913, and his copy is annotated. The etymology of the
name Abraxas can also be found in King, The Gnostics and Their Remains, p. 37.

111 The name ‘Jeu’ or ‘Ieu’ seems to be a Greek corruption of the Hebrew IHVH, similar
to IAO, and is a magical name used to connote a god; see Betz, The Greek Magical Papyri,

Orphic Blessing’, Journal of the Warburg Institute 2:4 (1939), pp. 370–71. The first compilation of the Orphic fragments, Otto Kern’s Orphicorum fragmenta (Berlin: Weidmann,
1922), was published while Jung was still working on Liber Novus; he eventually became
familiar with this work (see Jung, CW13, ¶412, n. 11), but it had not yet appeared when
he wrote Psychology of the Unconscious. At that time he relied on Taylor’s The Mystical Hymns of Orpheus, Mead’s Orpheus, and Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher’s Ausfürliches
Lexikon der griechischen und römischen Mythologie Lexicon (Leiden: Teubner, 1884).
118 Hermetica, CH XIII.
119 See, for example, The Gospel of Philip, in The Apocryphal New Testament, trans. and ed.
M.R. James (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924), 12; the ritual pronouncements that enable the soul to bypass the planetary archons are almost identical to those of the Orphic
funerary tablets. Jung possessed copies of James’ work in both English and German,
along with other earlier English and German translations of apocryphal texts. These
included Alexander Walker’s Apocryphal Gospels, Acts, and Revelations (Edinburgh: T&T
Clark, 1911), which contains the Gospel of Philip.
120 Jung, CW15, ¶81.
121 See Noll, The Jung Cult, for an example of this assumption.
122 Jung owned several works by Blavatsky, including an English edition of The Secret Doctrine, 2 volumes (London: Theosophical Publishing House, 1888) and The Theosophical

133 Stephan Hoeller states that Jung and Mead visited each other, attributing his information to a private conversation with the historian of religion, Gilles Quispel, who knew
Jung well through their attendance at the Eranos conferences. Mead’s letter confirms
this statement. See Hoeller, ‘C.G. Jung and the Alchemical Revival’, p. 35, n. 1.
134 Jung acquired all of Meyrink’s ‘occult’ novels, including Der Engel vom westlichen Fenster (1927), Fledermäuse: Sieben Geschichten (1916), Der Golem (1915), Das grüne Gesicht (1916), and Walpurgisnacht (1917). For his references to Meyrink, see Jung, CW6,

he became vice president of the General Medical Society for Psychotherapy, and was
awarded the Literary Prize of the City of Zürich in 1932. In the same year, he completed his entries in the Black Books. In 1933, the Eranos conferences began at Ascona,
where Jung delivered the first of many papers he was to give at these events in subsequent years: ‘A Study in the Process of Individuation’ ( Jung, CW9i, ¶¶525–626). Also
in 1933, Jung began lecturing at the ETH, and in 1934 he founded the International
General Medical Society for Psychotherapy and became its first president and editor of
its journal, Zentralblatt für Psychotherapie und ihre Grenzgebiete. In 1935, he became titular
professor at the ETH, and founded the Swiss Society for Practical Psychology.

‘THE WAY OF WHAT IS TO COME’

When we speak of the new Aquarian type of person, we are actually referring
to human beings through whom will be released . . . the energies, the faith, the
downflowing enthusiasm and revelations of the new Age . . . These true ‘Aquarians’ . . . are mouthpieces for the new spirit, and many of them may almost be
called born ‘mediums’ for the release of that spirit at the beginning of the new
cycle.1
—Dane Rudhyar

When the month of the Twins had ended, the men said to their shadows: ‘You
are I’ . . . Thus the two became one, and through this collision the formidable
broke out, precisely that spring of consciousness that one calls culture and which
lasted until the time of Christ. But the fish indicated the moment when what
was united split, according to the eternal law of contrasts, into an underworld
and upperworld . . . But the separated cannot remain separated forever. It will be
united again and the month of the fish will soon be over.2
—C.G. Jung

The idea of the ‘New Age’
In the last two decades, a considerable amount of scholarly literature has been
dedicated to Jung’s influence on so-called New Age beliefs and practices.3 Olav
Hammer, following Richard Noll, uses the term ‘Jungianism’ to describe a form of
‘modern psycho-religion’ based on the cult-like role assigned to Jung as a New Age
guru.4 Paul Heelas has identified Jung as one of three key figures in the development
of New Age thought, the other two being H.P. Blavatsky and Georges Ivanovich
Gurdjieff (1866–1949), whose spiritual system, referred to as the ‘Fourth Way’,
focuses on the development of higher states of consciousness.5 Wouter Hanegraaff,



152 ‘The way of what is to come’

also following Noll, views Jung as a ‘modern esotericist, who represents a crucial
link between traditional . . . esoteric worldviews and the New Age movement’.6
There are certainly broad parallels between Jung’s psychological models and
those currents of ‘New Age’ thought that emphasise the enlargement of consciousness. This can be explained, in part, by the fact that both Jung and the late nineteenth-century occult revival, which provided the basis for many of the most potent
New Age ideas, drew on the same pool of sources: Hermetic, Platonic, Neoplatonic,
Gnostic, and Jewish esoteric speculations and practices, along with liberal dashes
of Hindu and Buddhist thought. Many New Age religious approaches had thus
already been fully formed by the end of the nineteenth century. Roderick Main, in
a paper on the relationship between Jung’s ideas and New Age thought, comments:
It is possible to construe that Jungian psychology, even as originally expounded
by Jung, may itself have been influenced by New Age thinking . . . While
Jung certainly influenced the New Age movement, he may himself have
been influenced by New Age religion or was even one of its representatives.7
The idea of the New Age as an astrologically defined epoch – assumed, in modern times, to be the incoming ‘Aquarian Age’ – began to take shape in the late
eighteenth century, crystallised in the nineteenth, and is still popular today. Dane
Rudhyar believed that the Aquarian Age would commence in 2060, although he
thought that its ‘seed period’ had begun between 1844–46.8 Wouter Hanegraaff, in
his important work, New Age Religion and Western Culture, refers to the New Age ‘in
sensu strictu’: those currents of ideas which focus on the expectation of an imminent
Aquarian Age and an accompanying radical shift in consciousness reflecting the
meaning of the astrological constellation. Hanegraaff then discusses the New Age
‘in sensu lato’: an innovative movement ‘in a general sense’ which does not necessarily bear a specifically astrological connotation.9
This is a useful heuristic approach through which to explore many current spiritualities. But it is difficult to find agreement among authors about just what constitutes New Age in the broad sense. Many of the ideas that form the basis of New
Age thought are very ancient, and have not been significantly altered by another
exceedingly ambiguous term, ‘modernity’. They might equally be viewed as ‘Old
Age’, as they reflect certain consistent cosmological and anthropological themes
that possess great agency and are immensely culturally adaptable, while maintaining
a structural integrity for more than two millennia. These ideas have not necessarily
been ‘secularised’ in the sense that their present-day adherents have become ‘irreligious’, nor in the sense that they eschew a specific organised form of religion. Jung
viewed such ideas as archetypal: they belong to the ‘Spirit of the Depths’, and not,
as might be assumed, the ‘Spirit of This Time’.
New Age ideas – particularly the conviction that self-awareness and God-awareness are indistinguishable, and that God can be found within – are assumed by some
scholars to be unique to ‘modern’ spiritualities. This assumption is not supported by
textual evidence. The equation of ‘god-knowledge’ with ‘self-knowledge’ is clearly



‘The way of what is to come’

153

expressed in Hermetic, Neoplatonic, Gnostic, and early Jewish esoteric literature.10
In this sense, Hanegraaff ’s assumption of the modernity of New Age thought may
be misleading, creating sharp artificial divisions between historical periods, cultures,
and spheres of human expression in which a more nuanced perspective might be
more helpful. But however problematic the definitions of New Age in sensu lato
might be, Jung’s thinking about the incoming New Age clearly belongs in the category Hanegraaff calls ‘in sensu strictu’; for it seems that Jung believed wholeheartedly that a new epoch reflecting the symbolism of the constellation of Aquarius
was about to dawn, and that his psychology might make a significant contribution
to the conflicts inevitably arising in the face of such a profound shift in collective
consciousness.

The god in the egg
In 1951, following two heart attacks, Jung wrote a work called Aion.11 For the
frontispiece, he chose a Roman sculpture of the Mithraic god known to scholars
variously as Aion, Aeon, Kronos, Chronos, or Zervan (see Plate 4).12
While he worked on Liber Novus, Jung relied in large part on Dieterich’s German and Mead’s English translations of the Mithras Liturgy. He also acquired Franz
Cumont’s two books on Mithraism: Die Mysterien des Mithra and the earlier, much
lengthier Textes et monuments figurés relatifs aux mystères de Mythra.13 Jung referred to
Cumont as ‘the foremost authority on the Mithraic cult’.14 But Cumont rejected
the central importance of astrology in Roman Mithraic worship, viewing its astrological iconography as properly belonging to the earlier, ‘Chaldaean’ form of the
cult, and blaming this older ‘Oriental’ religious current for infecting Western beliefs
with astrology’s ‘long train of errors and terrors’.15 It seems that Jung did not agree.
In recent years, Roger Beck and David Ulansey have challenged Cumont’s
assumptions, focusing specifically on the astrological foundations of Roman Mithraism.16 Mithraic archaeological finds have provided the chief source for these
examinations; the cult’s initiations were a well-kept secret, and no body of literature
exists produced directly by its members. Only references have survived, often based
on hearsay, in the writings of late antique authors such as Origen and Porphyry.17
But numerous images of Aion have survived the centuries, discovered in Roman
Mithraea throughout Europe. They typically present a winged lion-headed male
figure holding a staff and a key, enveloped in the coils of a serpent, and usually –
although not invariably – surrounded by, or bearing on his body, the signs of the
zodiac.18
The Greek word aionos has a number of different meanings and usages, all of
which are relevant to Jung’s understanding of the imminent collective psychic
change he envisioned in Liber Novus.19 Homer and Herodotus used the word to
describe the lifetime of an individual.20 Euripides, in common with some Hermetic treatises, personified Aion as a divine being, calling him the ‘child of time’
who ‘brings many things to pass’.21 Aeschylus and Demosthenes used the word to
describe both an epoch and a generation.22 Sophocles understood it as one’s destiny



154 ‘The way of what is to come’

or lot, akin to the idea of moira.23 Hesiod used it to define an age or era, such as
the Age of Gold or the Age of Iron.24 Paul used it to refer to the present world, as
well as an era or epoch.25 In Plato’s Timaeus, aionos, in contrast to chronos, constitutes
eternity, while chronos expresses aionos temporally through the movements of the
heavenly bodies:
Now the nature of the ideal being was eternal, but to bestow this attribute
in its fullness upon a creature was impossible. Wherefore he resolved to have
a moving image of eternity [aionos], and when he set in order the heaven,
he made this image eternal but moving according to number, while eternity
itself rests in unity; and this image we call time [chronos].26
Jung seems to have favoured the idea of an aion as both an astrological epoch –
lasting roughly 2,165 years, or one-twelfth of what he believed to be the great
‘Platonic Year’ of 26,000 years – and a god-image, emerging out of the human
religious imagination and embodying the specific qualities of that epoch. These
astrological epochs are reflected by the astronomical phenomenon of the precession of the equinoxes: the gradual backward movement of the spring equinox (the
moment each year when the Sun enters the zodiacal sign of Aries) through the stars
of the twelve zodiacal constellations.27
Pistis Sophia describes the aions as both celestial powers ruling over specific
regions of the cosmos, and the regions themselves: zodiacal constellations with
doorways or gates through which the redeemer-god passes as he accomplishes his
task of salvation.28 In contrast, the Mithras Liturgy presents Aion, not as a zodiacal
constellation, a planetary archon, or an epoch of time, but as a fiery primal divinity, also called Helios-Mithras: as Jung understood it, an image of the libido or
life-force.29 A vision of this eternal being is the goal of the ritual, leading to the
temporary ‘immortalisation’ of the initiate.30
For I am to behold today with Deathless Eyes – I, mortal, born of mortal womb,
but [now] made better by the Might of Mighty Power, yea, by the Incorruptible Right Hand – [I am to see today] by virtue of the Deathless Spirit the
Deathless Aeon [αθανατον Αιωνα], the master of the Diadems of Fire.31
Later in the ritual, prayers are offered to the ‘seven Fates of heaven’, the planetary divinities governing Heimarmene. An invocation is then addressed to Aion that
names his primary attributes and functions:
Light-giver [and] Fire-sower; Fire-loosener, whose Life is in the Light; Firewhirler, who sett’st the Light in Motion; Thou Thunder-rouser; O Thou
Light-glory, Light-increaser; Controller of the Light Empyrean; O Thou
Star-tamer!32
Aion the ‘star-tamer’ emanates and controls the heavenly spheres, and the vision
vouchsafed the initiate in the Mithras Liturgy allows an identification with divinity



‘The way of what is to come’

155

that, at least for a time, breaks the power of Heimarmene.33 As we have seen, Jung
associated this freedom from the bonds of astral compulsion with the integrating
potency of a direct experience of the Self; like the Liturgy, he stipulated no guarantee of the permanence of the state. A comparison of Aion in the Liturgy with the
words of the giant Izdubar in Liber Novus, who rises out of the fiery egg revealed
as the Sun-god, suggests how profoundly the Mithras Liturgy affected Jung’s understanding of the astrological symbol of the Sun.
Streams of fire broke from my radiating body –
I surged through the blazing flames –
I swam in a sea that wrapped me in living fires –
Full of light, full of longing, full of eternity –
I was ancient and perpetually renewing myself . . .
I am the sun.34
Jung’s description of Aion included the name Kronos (Saturn), but he elided it with
chronos (time) and emphasised the leonine attributes of the figure:
We come across in the Mithraic religion, a strange God of Time, Aion, called
Kronos or Deus Leontocephalus, because his stereotyped representation is a
lion-headed man, who, standing in a rigid attitude, is encoiled by a snake . . .
In addition to that, the figure sometimes bears the Zodiac on his body . . . He
is a symbol of time, most interestingly composed from libido-symbols. The
lion, the zodiac sign of the greatest summer heat, is the symbol of the most
mighty desire.35
Paradoxically, Jung associated this ‘Deus Leontocephalus’ not only with the Sun,
but also with the Gnostic archon Ialdabaoth and the archon’s planet, Saturn.36
Aion was many things for Jung: a fiery libido-symbol embracing all opposites; a
symbol of time expressed through the solar pathway of the zodiacal round; and a
personification of the planetary deity Saturn-Kronos, his own horoscopic ruler.
Aion may thus also be understood as the universal or collective aspect of Jung’s
‘personal daimon’ Philemon, the ‘Master of the House’.37 And Aion, for Jung,
embodied an astrological age – that of Aquarius – which combines, in its imagery
and meaning, the human form of the Water-bearer with its opposite constellation of Leo, the Lion. In one of the early paintings in Liber Primus, the symbols
of the polarity of the new Aion, Aquarius and Leo, are presented: the Lion stands
at the top left of the image with a red solar disk over his head, while the Waterbearer, dressed in a blue robe rather than in the harlequin pattern of the later
‘Caster of Holy Water’, stands at the top right of the image pouring his water
from a red urn, with the glyph of Saturn by his left shoulder.38 William Butler
Yeats, preoccupied with the same zodiacal polarity, described his own vision of
the approaching New Age in his poem, The Second Coming, written just after the
Armageddon of the Great War, with a prophetic pessimism not unlike Jung’s
own: a terrifying being with a lion’s body and the head of a man, that ‘slouches



156 ‘The way of what is to come’

toward Bethlehem to be born’ in the midst of chaos and the disintegration of
social order.39
In Liber Novus, Jung described his own transformation into a leontocephalic
deity encircled by a serpent, with ‘outstretched arms like someone crucified’.40
Later, he explicitly related this vision to the Mithraic iconography of Aion:41
The animal face which I felt mine transformed into was the famous [Deus]
Leontocephalus of the Mithraic mysteries. It is the figure which is represented with a snake coiled around the man, the snake’s head resting on the
man’s head, and the face of the man that of the lion.42
This allusion suggests a deeply personal significance underlying Jung’s choice of
the frontispiece for Aion. The vision in Liber Novus, like that of the Mithras Liturgy,
describes a transient, although profoundly transformative, inner experience resulting in an enlarged consciousness and, in Jung’s terminology, a fuller integration of
the personality. In Jung’s natal horoscope, as he was well aware, the opposites of
Aquarius and Leo dominate. Aquarius was rising at the moment of Jung’s birth, and
the Sun was placed in Leo. It is not surprising that he felt the symbolism of Aion
was relevant, not only for the collective psyche, but for his own.

The age of Aquarius
The first image on the first page of Liber Novus incorporates the letter D, illuminated in the style of a medieval German manuscript, and introduces the opening
sentence of the work: Der Weg des kommenden (‘The Way of What Is to Come’).
An astrological ‘strip’ can be seen at the top of the image (see Plate 5); it is
painted in a blue lighter than that of the sky with its heavenly bodies.43 The zodiacal constellations, represented by their traditional glyphs, run in counterclockwise
order, beginning with Cancer at the far left, followed by Gemini, Taurus, Aries,
and Pisces, and concluding with Aquarius at the far right. The large four-rayed
star in the ‘strip’ is placed at the precise meeting-point between the constellation
represented by the glyph of Pisces and the constellation represented by the glyph
of Aquarius. The star evidently represents the Sun at the moment of the annual
spring equinox.44 This equinoctial point, slowly creeping backward through the
constellations over the centuries, has, according to Jung, now reached the end of
the constellation of Pisces and is about to enter its 2,165-year journey through
the constellation of Aquarius. Jung referred to this astronomical event as the new
Aion, the ‘Way of What Is to Come’. He later called it ‘καιρος – the right time –
for a “metamorphosis of the gods” ’.45
The major theme of Aion is the shift in human consciousness, and a simultaneous shift in the God-image, reflected by the ending of the Piscean Aion. Pisces is
associated with the Christian symbols of Jesus and Satan as the two Fish, and the
advent of the Aquarian Aion is associated with a new symbol: humanity as the
Water-bearer. Lance Owens has suggested that it is necessary to cross-reference



‘The way of what is to come’

157

Aion with Liber Novus in order to understand both: Aion is Jung’s effort, late in life,
to provide a rational exegesis of the revelations of Liber Novus, and the two works
are ‘fundamentally wed’.46 Aion appears to offer a more impersonal involvement
with astrology than Jung’s preoccupation with his own horoscope. But his approach
to collective cycles incorporated the same psychological models as his perception
of psychic dynamics in the individual: archetypes, typologies, complexes, and astrological significators as symbols of the qualities of time. Jung believed that each of
the great shifts represented by a new astrological Aion is reflected in the imagery of
the presiding zodiacal constellation and its planetary ruler:
Apparently they are changes in the constellations of psychic dominants, of the
archetypes, or ‘gods’ as they used to be called, which bring about, or accompany, long-lasting transformations of the collective psyche. This transformation started in the historical era and left its traces first in the passing of the
aeon of Taurus into that of Aries, and then of Aries into Pisces, whose beginning coincides with the rise of Christianity. We are now nearing that great
change which may be expected when the spring-point enters Aquarius.47
While Aion discusses the historical nature of these transformations as they are
expressed in religious representations, Liber Novus reveals Jung’s understanding of
his own role in the imminent shift, in accordance with his conviction that every
individual is part of the collective, and that the future of the collective depends on
the consciousness of the individual.48
There has been considerable speculation as to where Jung acquired the idea of a
New Age in relation to the movement of the vernal equinoctial point. This seems
to be particularly important because Jung has been credited with being the first
person in modern times to disseminate the idea that the long-anticipated New Age
would be Aquarian. The idea of an Aquarian Age is rooted in the late eighteenthcentury Enlightenment, when a number of scholarly works were produced that
focused on the Christian figure of Jesus as one of a long line of solar deities.49
According to Nicholas Campion, the ideas presented in these works can be divided
into three distinct categories. First was the attempt to establish a common origin
for religions. Second came the theory that this shared origin lay in the worship of
the celestial bodies, especially the Sun. Third was the use of the precession of the
equinoxes to establish the dating of the Indian sacred texts known as the Vedas.50
Although none of the authors of these eighteenth-century works provided the
kind of interpretations offered by astrologers contemporary with Jung, all of them
emphasised the importance of the precessional cycle in the historical development
of religious images and ideas.
In 1775, the French astronomer and mathematician Jean Sylvain Bailly (1736–93)
proposed an astral origin for all religious forms.51 Bailly was followed by a French
lawyer and professor of rhetoric, Charles François Dupuis (1742–1809), who, in his
Origine de tous les cultes, argued that all religions sprang from Sun-worship, and that
Christianity was simply another form of solar myth.52 Dupuis, like Max Heindel



158 ‘The way of what is to come’

and Jung himself over a century later, noted the parallels between the astrological
constellation of Virgo and the mother of the solar messiah. Describing the engraving
he commissioned for the frontispiece of his book, Dupuis noted: ‘A woman holding
a child, crowned with stars, standing on a serpent, called the celestial Virgin . . . She
has been successively Isis, Themis, Ceres, Erigone, the mother of Christ’.53
Dupuis’ frontispiece (see Plate 6) combines the idea of a universal solar religion
with religious themes related to the precession of the equinoxes. At the upper left
corner, in the heavens, are the zodiacal constellations of Aries and Taurus, with the
Sun shining on the midpoint between them. The vernal equinoctial point is thus
crossing from Taurus to Aries, reflected in the shift from various Taurean religious
forms represented in the engraving (Mithras slaying the cosmic bull, the Egyptian
Apis-bull, the Golden Calf ) to those of Aries (Zeus enthroned as the god of heaven,
the Israelite High Priest before the Ark of the Covenant). At the top centre of the
frontispiece are the symbols of the Christian dispensation: the four Apostles with
their symbolic animals, the ‘celestial virgin’ crowned with stars, and the Christ-child
as the new-born Sun. Although Dupuis focused on the shift from Taurus to Aries
rather than from Pisces to Aquarius, there is a striking parallel between Dupuis’
illustration of the Sun at the midpoint between the constellations of Taurus and
Aries and Jung’s four-pointed solar star at the midpoint between the constellations
of Pisces and Aquarius on the opening page of Liber Novus. Jung never mentioned
Dupuis in his published work, nor is a copy of Origines listed in his library catalogue.
But it is probable that he was familiar with Dupuis’ book.
Speculations on a link between the precession of the vernal equinoctial point
and the changing of religious forms continued throughout the late eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. François-Henri-Stanislas de l’Aulnaye (1739–1830), who
authored two books on Freemasonry, produced a text in 1791 called L’histoire générale et particulière des religions et du cultes.54 Campion states that this work was the first
to consider the implications of the precession of the vernal equinoctial point into
Aquarius, which de l’Aulnaye believed had taken place in 1726.55 Godfrey Higgins (1772–1833), a religious historian whose work exercised a major influence on
Blavatsky,56 declared in his Anacalypsis, published in 1836, that the equinoctial shift
from Taurus into Aries was the time when ‘the slain lamb’ replaced ‘the slain bull’.57
In the late nineteenth century, Gerald Massey (1828–1907), an English poet and
self-educated Egyptologist, offered a detailed scheme of the evolution of religious
forms according to the precession of the equinoxes through the zodiacal constellations.58 It is in one of Massey’s papers, ‘The Historical Jesus and the Mythical
Christ’, privately published in 1887, that the first reference to the Age of Aquarius
appears in the English language:59
The foundations of a new heaven were laid in the sign of the Ram, 2410 bc;
and again, when the Equinox entered the sign of the Fishes, 255 bc. Prophecy
that will be again fulfilled when the Equinox enters the sign of the Waterman
about the end of this [nineteenth] century.60



‘The way of what is to come’

159

All of these authors – Dupuis, Delaunaye, Higgins, and Massey – utilised myths to
illustrate vast collective changes in religious forms and perceptions, and linked the
myths to particular zodiacal constellations in the cycle of precession. Although Jung
did not cite any of their writings in his own published work, nevertheless the same
ideas are central to Aion. That no one seems to have agreed on the date for the start
of the new Aquarian Aion is not surprising. As Jung himself stated: ‘The delimitation of the constellations is known to be somewhat arbitrary’.61

Ancient sources for the New Age
Texts explicitly relating the dawning of a New Age to the precession of the equinoxes may only have begun in the modern era. But Jung believed that earlier sources
supported his belief that a new astrological Aion was about to begin. His quest for
historical evidence of the idea of the incoming Aquarian Age sometimes led him to
assume connections that a twenty-first-century scholar, nervous of speculation of a
‘universalist’ kind, might well avoid. However, refusal to acknowledge the longevity and universality of certain ideas can itself reveal a powerful agenda, and Jung’s
intuitive leaps seem to have been valid more often than they were misguided. An
example of Jung’s search to find validation for the Aquarian Age in alchemical texts
is provided by the sixteenth-century alchemist and physician Heinrich Khunrath
(1560–1605),62 who declared that an ‘age of Saturn’ would begin at some point in
the not too distant future, and that it would usher in a time when alchemical secrets
would become available to everyone:
The age of Saturn is not yet, in which everything that is private shall become
public property: for one does not yet take and use that which is well meant
and well done in the same spirit.63
Khunrath does not mention either the precession of the equinoxes or the zodiacal
constellation of Aquarius anywhere in his text. Nor does the idea appear in any
other alchemical literature of the early modern period, steeped in astrology though
it was. But Jung believed that Khunrath was referring to the Age of Aquarius
because this constellation is traditionally ruled by Saturn. In a lecture given at the
ETH in 1940, Jung cited Khunrath’s statement, and then commented:
Khunrath means that the age of Saturn has not yet dawned . . . Obviously
the question is: what does Khunrath mean by the age of Saturn? The old
alchemists were of course also astrologers, and thought in an astrological
way. Saturn is the ruler of the sign of Aquarius, and it is quite possible that
Khunrath meant the coming age, the age of Aquarius, the water carrier,
which is almost due now. It is conceivable that he thought mankind would
be changed by that time, and would be able to understand the alchemists’
mystery.64



160 ‘The way of what is to come’

Jung found in this influential alchemist’s work what he perceived as evidence that
the Age of Aquarius would be concerned with revelations of an esoteric and psychological nature, ‘secrets’ that had either been lost or had never been known,
and whose emergence into collective consciousness would result in an important
transformation in human self-awareness. Despite his pessimism about the capacity
for global self-destruction inherent in the interiorisation of the god-archetype, Jung
was, at least initially, optimistic about the psychological potential of the New Age.
In Gnostic literature, Jung may also have found similar ‘evidence’ of a belief in
precession as a herald of great religious changes – although here, as in Khunrath’s
writings, there are no explicit references about the astrological aions in relation to
the precession of the equinoctial point. The Gnostic text known as Trimorphic Protennoia speaks of a great disruption in the domains of the archons and their powers.
Horace Jeffery Hodges, in a paper discussing the Gnostic preoccupation with Heimarmene, suggests that this prophecy of great change in the celestial realms reflects
the Gnostics’ knowledge of the moving of the vernal equinoctial point from the
constellation of Aries into the constellation of Pisces.65 Since precession had already
been recognised by 130 bce, astrologically inclined Gnostics of the first centuries
ce might have been aware of it, although there is no surviving textual evidence that
they connected it with either the ‘Platonic Year’ or the astrological aions. However,
even if Trimorphic Protennoia really does refer to precession, neither Jung nor Mead
would have known about it in the early decades of the twentieth century, as the
only extant copy of the treatise was found at Nag Hammadi in 1945. But two other
Gnostic texts, to which Jung did have access, concern themselves with a great ‘disturbance’ in the heavenly realms. The Apocryphon of John, as described by Irenaeus,66
speaks of the breaking of the chains of astral fate by the advent of the Redeemer:
He [Christ] descended through the seven heavens . . . and gradually emptied
them of their power.67
Pistis Sophia also provides descriptions of a great ‘disturbance’ in the heavens. But
like the Apocryphon of John, there is no explicit reference to precession to be found
in the text.
David Ulansey has argued that the precession of the equinoxes provided the
basis for the central image of the Mithraic mysteries: the Tauroctony, or slaying of
the cosmic bull.68 But Ulansey’s work was not published until 1989, twenty-eight
years after Jung’s death. However, even before his break with Freud, Jung had linked
the symbolism of the bull in the Mithraic mysteries with the polarity of Taurus and
its opposite constellation, Scorpio, describing them as ‘sexuality destroying itself ’ in
the form of ‘active libido’, and ‘resistant (incestuous) libido’.69 By the time he wrote
Psychology of the Unconscious, Jung was well aware of the movement of the equinoctial point through the constellations:
Taurus and Scorpio are equinoctial signs, which clearly indicate that the sacrificial scene [the Tauroctony] refers primarily to the Sun cycle . . . Taurus



‘The way of what is to come’

161

and Scorpio are the equinoctial signs for the period from 4300 to 2150 bc.
These signs, long since superseded, were retained even in the Christian era.70
Jung had thus already begun to arrive at certain insights regarding the precession
of the equinoxes in relation to the significance of Mithraic iconography. But the
scholarly literature on Mithraism available at the time – primarily the works of
Cumont and Reitzenstein, and Dieterich’s translation of the Mithras Liturgy – did
not discuss precession. Nor did Mead in his own exegesis of Mithraism. Nevertheless, Jung seems to have been convinced that Taurus and Scorpio – the astrological aions he believed to have governed the period from 4300 to 2150 bce – were,
although ‘long since superseded’, still relevant as potent symbols of generation and
regeneration even in the Piscean era, when the Roman cult of Mithras first arose.
The so-called Platonic Year of 26,000 years was never described by Plato, as
precession had not been discovered in his time. Plato defined the ‘perfect year’ as
the return of the celestial bodies and the diurnal rotation of the fixed stars to their
original positions at the moment of creation.71 The Roman astrologer Julius Firmicus Maternus, echoing Plato, discussed a great cycle of 300,000 years, after which
the heavenly bodies will return to those positions that they held when the world
was first created.72 Firmicus seems to have combined Plato’s ‘perfect year’ with the
Stoic belief that the world undergoes successive conflagrations of fire and water,
after which it is regenerated. But the Stoics did not describe any transformations of
consciousness, as Jung did – only a precise replication of what had gone before.73
Various other authors of antiquity offered various other lengths for the Great Year,
ranging from 15,000 years to 2,484 years. But none of these speculations was based
on the movement of the vernal equinoctial point through the constellations.74 It
was in modern astrological, Theosophical, and occult literature that Jung found
inspiration for his own highly individual interpretation of the Aquarian Aion.

New sources for the New Age
Jung’s unique understanding of the meaning of Aquarius as the constellation of the
incoming Aion is not traceable to any ancient or medieval source. His chief perception of the Aquarian Aion rested on the idea of the union of the opposites, the
interiorisation of the god-image, and the struggle to recognise and reconcile good
and evil as dimensions of the human psyche.
We now have a new symbol in place of the [Piscean] fish: a psychological
concept of human wholeness.75
In a letter to Walter Robert Corti, written in 1929, Jung prophesied a time of
confusion preceding the new consciousness:
We live in the age of the decline of Christianity, when the metaphysical premises of morality are collapsing . . . That causes reactions in the unconscious,



162 ‘The way of what is to come’

restlessness and longing for the fulfilment of the times . . . When the confusion is at its height a new revelation comes, i.e. at the beginning of the fourth
month of world history.76
The ‘fourth month of world history’ is the Aion of Aquarius; ‘world history’ in
Jung’s context began with recorded history in the Aion of Taurus, which Jung
believed had occurred between 4300 and 2150 bce. The imminent collective transformation will, in Jung’s view, require a long and potentially dangerous process of
integration, as it would in an individual. Liber Novus, with its opening image of the
movement of the equinoctial point into Aquarius, and its frequent references to
Phanes-Abraxas, the androgynous, dark-light god of the new aion, might be understood as a highly personal narrative of precisely that integrative process within Jung
himself. Jung’s interest in Nietzsche’s work is likely to have contributed to the idea
that the celestial Water-bearer – one of only three zodiacal images bearing a human
form77 – might be a symbol of the Übermensch, the ‘Beyond-Man’ who transcends
the opposites. Nietzsche’s conviction that humanity was progressing toward a goal
that lay ‘beyond good and evil’ hints at the idea of the fully individuated human
being whom Jung hoped would emerge in the new Aion.78 But Nietzsche never
associated his Übermensch with Aquarius.
An obvious modern source for Jung’s expectations of a transformation of consciousness based on the precession of the equinoxes might seem to be the Theosophists, who certainly promulgated the idea of an imminent New Age. Blavatsky
was familiar with authors such as Higgins and Massey. But she did not equate her
New Age with the entry of the vernal equinoctial point into the constellation of
Aquarius, preferring to use what she referred to as ‘the Hindu idea of cosmogony’
(the concept of the Yugas) combined with certain fixed stars in relation to the
equinoctial point.79 According to Blavatsky, twelve transformations of the world
will occur, following a partial destruction by water or fire (a lift from the Stoics)
and the generation of a new world with a new twelvefold cycle. She identified this
idea as ‘the true Sabaean astrological doctrine’, which describes these twelve transformations as reflections of the twelve zodiacal constellations.80 But this approach
does not involve precession, and the twelve transformations do not comprise a
precessional cycle of 26,000 years; they comprise the entire history of the planet
over many millions of years.
In an article on the history of the idea of the New Age, Shepherd Simpson points
out that Jung, whom he credits with the first promulgation of the idea of an ‘Aquarian Age’ in modern times, could not have got the idea from Blavatsky.81 The German
esotericist Rudolf Steiner, whose Anthroposophical Society rejected the Eastern
inclinations of the Theosophists but retained many of their ideas, likewise subscribed
to the idea of a New Age, and referred to it as the ‘Age of Christ’s Second Coming’.
But this New Age, which, in Steiner’s view, began in 1899, is not Aquarian.
There is much talk about periods of transition. We are indeed living just
at the time when the Dark Age has run its course and a new epoch is just



‘The way of what is to come’

163

beginning, in which human beings will slowly and gradually develop new
faculties . . . What is beginning at this time will slowly prepare humanity for
new soul faculties.82
These ‘new soul faculties’ do indeed belong to the Aquarian Age, but they are only
in preparation. According to Steiner’s idiosyncratic reckoning, the Age of Aquarius
will not begin until 3573, and the world at present is still living in the Piscean Age,
which began in 1413.83 Steiner wrote extensively about the problem of evil; like
Jung, he believed evil to be a reality rather than a mere ‘deprivation of good’, and,
also like Jung, he was fascinated with but also repelled by Nietzsche’s ideas.84 Steiner
also understood the necessity for humans taking responsibility for evil:
Until now, the gods have taken care of human beings. Now, though, in this
fifth post-Atlantean epoch, our destiny, our power for good and evil, will
increasingly be handed over to us ourselves. It is therefore necessary to know
what good and evil mean, and to recognize them in the world.85
But Steiner was much closer to Gnostic perceptions than Jung was, and understood
evil to belong to the incarnate world and the spiritual potencies (Lucifer and Ahriman) who, like the Gnostic archons, work to inflame the innate selfishness and
destructiveness of the human being. Nor did Steiner associate the integration of
good and evil with an imminent Aquarian Age. Steiner was no more likely a source
for Jung’s understanding of the new Aion than Blavatsky was.
In 1906, Mead offered his own version of the New Age:
I too await the dawn of that New Age, but I doubt that the Gnosis of the
New Age will be new. Certainly it will be set forth in new forms, for the
forms can be infinite . . . Indeed, if I believe rightly, the very essence of
the Gnosis is the faith that man can transcend the limits of the duality that
makes him man, and become a consciously divine being.86
This idea of a resolution of the problem of duality is much closer to Jung’s formulation,
and Mead may have contributed important ideas to Jung’s vision of ‘The Way That Is
to Come’. In Aion, Jung elaborated on Mead’s description in a psychological context:
The approach of the next Platonic month, namely Aquarius, will constellate
the problem of the union of opposites. It will then no longer be possible to
write off evil as the mere privation of good; its real existence will have to
be recognized. This problem can be solved neither by philosophy, nor by
economics, nor by politics, but only by the individual human being, via his
experience of the living spirit.87
Jung’s view of the incoming new Aion was full of foreboding, and bears little
resemblance to the sentimentalised presentations of the ‘Age of Aquarius’ that



164 ‘The way of what is to come’

emerged during the 1960s, exemplified by Broadway’s first ‘concept’ musical, Hair,
in which the dawning New Age will be one of ‘harmony and understanding, sympathy and trust abounding’.88 The romantic idealism of these lyrics, and their cultural context, belong to a more optimistic and less cynical era. It is not surprising
that Jung – who, in 1913, a year before the outbreak of the Great War, experienced
a terrifying vision of ‘rivers of blood’ covering the whole of northern Europe89 –
initially anticipated the opening of the new Aion as a mortal struggle requiring
recognition of the ‘real existence’ of evil. But although Mead referred to the ‘cycles
of the Aeon’,90 he did not link these cycles with the precession of the equinoxes
in his published work. The New Age, whatever it might be, was apparently not,
for Mead, an Aquarian Age. While Jung turned to Mead’s work for insights into
many of the texts of late antiquity, it seems he looked elsewhere for ideas about the
meaning of the Water-bearer.
Two likelier sources for Jung’s ideas about the Age of Aquarius were the two
Theosophically inclined astrologers who provided Jung with much of his knowledge of astrology: Alan Leo and Max Heindel. Leo embraced Blavatsky’s idea
that humanity was at the midpoint of its millennia-old evolutionary cycle. But
he could not ignore the significance of the precession of the equinoxes, and he
directly associated the New Age with the constellation of Aquarius. In Esoteric
Astrology, first published in 1913 – the year that Jung began work on Liber Novus –
Leo declared:
I am actuated by the primary motive of expressing what I believe to be the
true Astrology, for the New Era that is now dawning upon the world.91
There is no mention of Aquarius in this statement. But two years earlier, Leo
had declared explicitly that he believed the Age of Aquarius would begin on 21
March 1928.92 Leo did his best to reconcile Blavatsky’s idea of the Hindu Yugas
with precession, but his conclusions were, in the end, closer to Jung’s:
The constellation of Taurus was in the first sign of the zodiac [i.e. Aries] at
the beginning of the Kali Yuga, and consequently the Equinoctial point fell
therein. At this time, also, Leo was in the summer solstice, Scorpio in the
autumnal equinox, and Aquarius in the winter solstice; and these facts form
the astronomical key to half the religious mysteries of the world – the Christian scheme included.93
In Leo’s view, the great cycle of precession is concerned with spiritual evolution, and the dawning Aquarian Age will mark the turning point of the cycle: the
beginning of humanity’s slow ascent back to the realm of pure spirit.94 Although
Jung used psychological models and wrote about wholeness and the integration of
opposites rather than a return to a perfected world of pure spirit, it seems that, in
principle, he agreed.



‘The way of what is to come’

165

Leo described the Aquarian Age in general terms. Max Heindel was more specific. His statement about the purpose of his Rosicrucian Fellowship, made in 1911,
emphasises the Aquarian character of the New Age:
It [the Rosicrucian Fellowship] is the herald of the Aquarian Age, when the
Sun by its precessional passage through the constellation Aquarius, will bring
out all the intellectual and spiritual potencies in man which are symbolized
by that sign.95
These burgeoning ‘intellectual and spiritual potencies’ did not, for Heindel, involve
the psychological problem of the integration of good and evil. In The Rosicrucian
Cosmo-Conception, published in 1909, Heindel provided a detailed explanation of
the precession of the equinoxes, calling the entire cycle a ‘World-year’.96 In accord
with the general tendency to disagree about when the New Age would commence,
Heindel declared that the Age of Aquarius would not begin for ‘a few hundred
years’.97
Heindel’s The Message of the Stars may have been more useful to Jung, as it
describes the astrological ages in relation to the polarity of each zodiacal constellation with its opposite. Heindel’s view that the Age of Aquarius contains the
attributes of Leo, the opposing constellation, must have been of considerable interest to Jung, who was inclined to view the workings of astrology, as well as human
psychology, as a dynamic tension between opposites. Heindel had presented this
theme in 1906, in Message of the Stars:
There are two sets of three pairs of signs, the first being Cancer and Capricorn, Gemini and Sagittarius, Taurus and Scorpio. In these pairs of signs we
may read the history of human evolution and religion . . . This is also divisible into three distinct periods, namely: THE ARYAN AGE, from Moses to
Christ, which comes under Aries-Libra;98 the PISCEAN AGE, which takes
in the last two thousand years under Pisces-Virgo Catholicism; and the two
thousand years which are ahead of us, called the AQUARIAN AGE, where
the signs Aquarius and Leo will be illuminated and vivified by the solar
precession.99
Heindel also discussed the religious symbolism of the astrological ages:
In the New Testament we find another animal, the Fish, attaining great
prominence, and the apostles were called to be ‘Fishers of Men’, for then
the sun by precession was nearing the cusp of Pisces, the Fishes, and Christ
spoke of the time when the Son of Man (Aquarius) shall come . . . A new
ideal will be found in the Lion of Judah, Leo. Courage of conviction,
strength of character and kindred virtues will then make man truly the
King of Creation.100



166 ‘The way of what is to come’

Heindel’s ‘Son of Man’, with his Leonine ‘courage’ and ‘strength’, abounds with
echoes of Nietzsche’s Übermensch. Jung, like Heindel, developed the idea that an
astrological age reflects the symbolism of two opposing constellations. This is
emphasised not only in Jung’s discussions of the Pisces-Virgo polarity in Aion, but
also in numerous ways through the imagery in Liber Novus. For example, in one
of the early paintings in Liber Primus, the symbols of the polarity of the new Aion,
Aquarius and Leo, are presented: the Lion stands at the top left of the image with a
red solar disk over his head, while the Water-bearer, dressed in a blue robe, stands
at the top right of the image pouring his water from a red urn, with the glyph of
Saturn by his left shoulder.101 This is only one instance of Jung’s incorporation of
the Aquarius-Leo polarity in Liber Novus. But Jung was not as optimistic as Heindel about the new Aion. Jung did not assume the union of the opposites to be a
smooth passage into a higher and more loving stage of spiritual consciousness, as
did the Theosophists and the ‘New Age’ proponents of the late twentieth century.
He foresaw ‘a new advance in human development’,102 but he viewed the transition into the Aquarian Aion as a dangerous time fraught with the human potential
for self-destruction. In a letter to Father Victor White, written in April 1954, Jung
stated that the shift into the Aion of Aquarius
means that man will be essentially God and God man. The signs pointing in
this direction consist in the fact that the cosmic power of self-destruction is
given into the hands of man.103
With even more overt pessimism, he wrote a year later to Adolf Keller:
And now we are moving into Aquarius, of which the Sibylline books say:
Luciferi vires accendit Aquarius acres (Aquarius inflames the savage forces of
Lucifer). And we are only at the beginning of this apocalyptic development!104
In light of the history of the twentieth century, it seems that Jung’s dark prophecy
was not inaccurate.

The timing of the new aion
There has never been any accord among authors about the date for the commencement of the New Age. At the end of the eighteenth century, de l’Aulnaye believed
that the Aquarian Aion had begun in 1726. At the end of the nineteenth century,
Gerald Massey insisted that the Age of Pisces began in 255 bce with the ‘actual’
birth of Jesus, and that the equinoctial point would move into the constellation of
Aquarius in 1901.105 Alan Leo offered the very specific date of 21 March 1928 –
the day of the vernal equinox of that year – while Dane Rudhyar, writing in 1969,
suggested the Aquarian Age had begun in 1905.106 And Rudolf Steiner, in the early
decades of the twentieth century, was convinced the Age of Aquarius would not
start until 3573.



‘The way of what is to come’

167

Jung was initially equally precise, and equally independent, about the date on
which the new Aion would begin. In August 1940, he wrote to H.G. Baynes:
This is the fateful year for which I have waited more than 25 years . . . 1940
is the year when we approach the meridian of the first star in Aquarius. It is
the premonitory earthquake of the New Age.107
This date did not come from esoteric literature, but from a young Dutch Jewish astronomer named Rebekka Aleida Biegel (1886–1943), who had moved to
Zürich in 1911 to take her doctorate in astronomy at the university.108
She became Jung’s patient and then trained with him, giving papers at the Association for Analytical Psychology in Zürich between 1916 and 1918. One of these
papers, presented in 1916, was titled ‘Die Mathematische Parallele zür Psychoanalyse’; based on the observations made in her paper, Jung credited Biegel with the
term ‘transcendent function’,109 which he described soon afterward, in an essay
written in the same year, as ‘comparable in its way with a mathematical function of
the same name’, and which he defined as ‘the union of conscious and unconscious

FIGURE 6.1 Rebekka Aleida Biegel



168 ‘The way of what is to come’

contents’.110 In 1917, he further noted that he had only recently discovered ‘that the
idea of the transcendent function also occurs in the higher mathematics’.111
In 1918, while Biegel was working at the Zürich Observatory, then located in
Gloriastrasse in the centre of the city, she sent Jung an envelope of materials which
he marked ‘Astrologie’ and kept in his desk at home.112 Biegel went to considerable
trouble to prepare a lengthy list of calculations indicating when the vernal equinoctial point – the moment when the Sun enters the first degree of the zodiacal sign of
Aries each year – aligned with each of the stars in the constellations of both Pisces
and Aquarius. Along with these calculations, Biegel’s covering letter offered three
possible dates for the beginning of the Aquarian Aion: 1940 (when the equinoctial
point aligned with the midpoint between the last star of Pisces and the first star of
Aquarius), 2129, and 2245 (when the equinoctial point aligned with two different stars in the constellation of Aquarius, either of which might be considered the
‘beginning’ of the constellation).113 What Jung called the ‘premonitory earthquake’
of the Aquarian Aion, according to Biegel’s first suggested date of 1940, coincided
with some of the worst chapters of the Second World War. Germany invaded and
occupied Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France; Hitler signed
his Axis pact with Mussolini; the Blitz began in London; and the largest concentration camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, was opened in Poland, where over a million
people would be murdered in the course of the next five years.
Jung later became less certain about the date of the commencement of the
Aquarian Aion. In an essay titled ‘The Sign of the Fishes’, written in 1958,114 he
stated that the equinoctial point ‘will enter Aquarius in the course of the third millennium’.115 In a footnote to this paragraph, Jung explained that, according to the
preferred starting-point, the advent of the new Aion ‘falls between ad 2000 and
2200’, but that ‘this date is very indefinite’ because ‘the delimitation of the constellations is known to be somewhat arbitrary’.116 But the ‘indefinite’ and ‘arbitrary’
nature of the date did not deter Jung from his lifelong conviction that the Aquarian
Aion was coming soon, and that its initial impact would not be pleasant.

The birth chart of Jesus
Jung was as preoccupied with discovering the birth date of Jesus, whom he believed
to be the avatar and chief symbol of the Piscean Aion, as he was with the date
of the beginning of the aion itself. He was not alone in this quest, although his
understanding of its importance in relation to archetypal patterns in the collective
unconscious was unique. Jung had a wide range of references from the late eighteenth century onward which had already made an explicit link between Christ, the
zodiacal image of Pisces, and the fish as a major symbol of Christian belief. These
references included a work called The Zodia by E.M. Smith, published in 1906, in
which Smith declared: ‘Modern astrological speculation . . . associates the Fishes
with Christ’.117
The search for the ‘true’ nativity of Jesus, although understandably not of particular interest to pagan astrologers in late antiquity, began in the Arab world in



‘The way of what is to come’

169

the eighth century and has continued to the present day.118 But it has not always
involved the equation of Jesus’ horoscope with the advent of the Piscean Age.
Arab astrologers were more interested in Jesus’ birth in relation to the ‘great mutation cycle’ of Jupiter and Saturn. These planets are aligned in conjunction along
the ecliptic roughly every twenty years, but they take 960 years to return to a
conjunction in a sign of the same element. This ‘great mutation cycle’ of nearly a
millennium was based on early Sassanian Persian astrological theories that the conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn underpinned the great cycles of world history and
the rise and fall of kings. As Jung was familiar with the work of Arab exegesists such
as Abu Ma’shar, as well as with the writings of Kepler, who discussed the cycle in
the early seventeenth century, the Jupiter-Saturn cycle did not escape his notice.119
Nor did Jung neglect the writings of the thirteenth-century astrologer and
magus Albertus Magnus, who insisted that Virgo was rising when Jesus was
born,121 or the speculations of the fourteenth-century Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly, who
agreed.122 Jerome Cardanus, another of Jung’s favoured early modern astrologers,
also prepared a horoscope for Jesus, using the traditional date of 25 December, just
after the winter solstice. Cardanus proposed a birth year of 1 bce, with Libra rather
than Virgo rising.123 Jung compared all these ‘ideal horoscopes for Christ’ in Aion,124
and concluded that the ‘correct’ birth date for Jesus was, in fact, 7 bce, as the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in Pisces in that year, with Mars in opposition from
Virgo, was ‘exceptionally large and of an impressive brilliance’.125 But rather than

FIGURE 6.2 Kepler’s diagram of the Great Mutation Cycle of Jupiter and Saturn120



170 ‘The way of what is to come’

accepting 25 December as the date of birth, Jung followed the calculations of the
German astronomer Oswald Gerhardt, and proposed 29 May, the date on which the
configuration of Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars had been exact.126 This resulted in Jesus’
Sun-sign as Gemini: the ‘motif of the hostile brothers’ that Jung believed to be one
of the dominant archetypal themes of the Piscean Aion.
In Jung’s discussions about the symbolism of the Fishes, he revealed a perspective on astrological images that is firmly focused on the archetypal meaning of a
zodiacal symbol rather than its characterological qualities, and on its relationship
with the ‘God-image’ – synonymous with the image of the Self – as it appears in
the human psyche.
As the highest value and supreme dominant in the psychic hierarchy, the
God-image is immediately related to, or identical with, the self, and everything that happens to the God-image has an effect on the latter.127
The religious symbols of each zodiacal Aion thus faithfully reflect in imaginal form
the ‘highest value and supreme dominant’ in the collective psyche for a particular
epoch of history. At the beginning of Liber Novus, Jung emphasised the importance
of this changing God-image:
It is not the coming God himself, but his image which appears in the supreme
meaning. God is an image, and those who worship him must worship him in
the images of the supreme meaning.128
Rebekka Biegel had indicated 4 bce as the beginning of the Piscean Aion, based
on the movement of the equinoctial point. Jung’s interest in the Jupiter-Saturn
conjunction of 7 bce, just three years earlier, led him to conclude that this configuration was the ‘star of Bethlehem’ that had appeared as the augury of Jesus’ birth:
Christ was born at the beginning of the aeon of the Fishes. It is by no means
ruled out that there were educated Christians who knew of the coniunctio maxima of Jupiter and Saturn in Pisces in the year 7 bc, just as, according to the gospel reports, there were Chaldaeans who actually found Christ’s birthplace.129
Jung amalgamated the image of Christ as the ‘supreme meaning’ of the incoming
Piscean Aion with the coniunctio maxima of Jupiter and Saturn in the zodiacal sign
of Pisces.130 He viewed the Aquarian Aion as the epoch when individuals would
interiorise the God-image; thus he did not anticipate a new avatar for the new Aion
who would manifest ‘out there’. He declined to adopt Steiner’s belief in a ‘Second
Coming’ of Jesus, or Annie Besant’s expectation of a ‘New World Teacher’.
We now recognize that the anointed of this time is a God who does not
appear in the flesh; he is no man and yet is a son of man, but in spirit and not



‘The way of what is to come’

171

in flesh; hence he can be born only through the spirit of men as the conceiving womb of the God.131
Nor is Phanes, the new aionic god of Liber Novus, in any way human; he/she is
androgynous and spherical, like Plato’s World Soul.132 Jung did not believe any
single person would personify the spirit of the new dispensation; the Water-bearer
‘seems to represent the self ’.133 He understood his own role as important, but as an
individual, not an avatar, who could help to illuminate the difficult psychological
process of interiorisation through his published work. Jung’s understanding of the
Aquarian Aion ultimately mirrors that of Alan Leo, who insisted that ‘the inner
nature and destiny of this sign is expressed in the one word Humanity’.134

and it is the name used for the planet Saturn in Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos, which was written
in Greek. Chronos (χρονος) is the Greek word for time. Zervan (or Zurvan) is a Persian
pre-Zoroastrian deity whose name, like the Greek chronos, means ‘time’; he is lord of
the finite time of history as well as ‘boundless time’, the primordial light out of which
everything has emanated. This deity bears many similarities with the Orphic Phanes; see

CONCLUSION

He [Socrates] had frequently declared in public he had received counsel from a
divine voice, which he called his Daimon . . . He ought to have taken care not
to pass with his friends either for a liar or a visionary; and yet how could he
avoid incurring that censure if events had not justified the truth of the things he
claimed were revealed to him?1
—Xenophon

Meaninglessness inhibits fullness of life and is therefore equivalent to illness.
Meaning makes a great many things endurable – perhaps everything. No science
will ever replace myth, and a myth cannot be made out of any science. For it is
not that ‘God’ is a myth, but that myth is the revelation of a divine life in man.2
—C.G. Jung

‘The darned stuff even works after death’3
Based on his published statements, his letters, and the materials in his private
archives, the evidence of Jung’s profound and lasting commitment to astrology is
inarguable. It might even be suggested that astrology was as important to him as
alchemy, in terms of both a method of hermeneutics and a symbolic mapping of
psychic processes, and provided him with a tool that he actively utilised in his psychotherapeutic practice throughout his adult life. However, in academic and clinical
circles, Jung’s commitment to astrology, and all that this might imply in terms of the
development of his psychological models, has remained largely unexplored.
The lack of any reference to astrology is predictable in biographies about Jung
written in the latter part of the twentieth century, and it would not be surprising if
Aniele Jaffé’s selective editing of Memories, Dreams, Reflections eradicated any mention Jung might have made about astrology’s importance to him. But this lack is



178 Conclusion

surprising in terms of the more inclusive and pluralistic approaches of twenty-firstcentury scholarship. An example of this tendency to utilise the old Roman practice of damnatio memoriae can be found in David Tacey’s otherwise comprehensive
work, Jung and the New Age. There is no reference whatsoever to Jung’s astrology in
this monograph, although astrology is usually considered as both a major New Age
current and a central feature of the fin-de-siècle occult revival that contributed so
many ideas to both contemporary New Age thought and to Jung’s own developing
theories.4 Likewise, Jung’s impact on modern astrologies, not least through his own
astrology, has been considerable, but is not discussed in Tacey’s work.
When Jung’s involvement with astrology is acknowledged, the ways in which it
is treated can be equally problematic. Some authors view Jung’s astrological work
as either an interest that waned over time, or a kind of eccentric hobby that had
no significant bearing on his theories and practice, like a harmless obsession with
growing giant marrows. Roderick Main’s analysis of Jung’s ideas about synchronicity, The Rupture of Time, fully acknowledges Jung’s interest in astrology and his
psychological interpretation of it. But Main suggests that, by the 1950s, Jung had
‘replaced’ astrology with other ideas about the workings of synchronicity.5 However, it might be suggested instead that Jung simply found newer, more collectively
acceptable ways of defining astrological sumpatheia. He certainly never ceased to
seek a scientific explanation for the validity of astrology. But the idea that he had
outgrown it in later life is belied not only by his lengthy statements to André Barbault, and by his recommendation to Ira Progoff that all psychotherapists should
learn astrology, but also by his declaration to his daughter, made as he was dying,
that ‘the darned stuff even works after death’. Main seems to associate Jung’s initial
interest in astrology with an esoteric ‘fashion’ that was current in the first decades
of the twentieth century, and does not discuss the extent to which Jung’s immersion
in the subject might have significantly helped to shape his psychological models of
individuation, complexes, and typology.
Other works, while acknowledging the seriousness of Jung’s commitment, use
it as a justification for the insistence that his psychology is not really psychology at
all, but a form of esotericism disguised as psychology, and therefore suspect within
the scientific edifice of psychological and psychiatric research and practice. This
response is typified by both Richard Noll and Wouter Hanegraaff. Noll suggests
that Jung’s interest in astrology stemmed from his Theosophical leanings, which
developed through the influence of G.R.S. Mead,6 and that these Theosophical
inclinations formed an important part of Jung’s ‘religion-building proclivities’ and
served his purported efforts to create his own occult ‘movement’.7 That Jung was
profoundly suspicious of movements such as Theosophy and Anthroposophy, primarily because of their lack of psychological insight, appears to have escaped Noll’s
notice. Hanegraaff, who seems to have based his analysis of Jung mainly on Noll’s
views rather than on Jung’s own writings, insists that Jung ‘resorted’ to ‘models
derived from cosmology’ to describe the human psyche, as though such cosmological models were somehow generated by an external source other than the psyche
itself and are therefore irrelevant to psychology. Moreover, according to Hanegraaff,



Conclusion 179

Jung’s work ‘lends scientific legitimacy to religious beliefs’, but that ultimately Jung
had more in common with Blavatsky than with Freud, because he was ‘a modern
esotericist’ who promulgated a ‘cult of the Interior Sun’.8
If the innate assumptions and ‘researcher’s bias’ in such perceptions are recognised, and the evidence is explored with more thoroughness and some effort to
achieve greater neutrality, it becomes possible to ask more relevant questions. What
kind of astrology did Jung practice? Where did he learn it? Why did he experience
it as useful, and in what ways? How did he understand its longevity, and how did he
incorporate its insights into his psychological work? This book has been an effort
to demonstrate, not only the deep and enduring involvement with astrology that
Jung pursued throughout his adult life, but also how he defined astrology, how he
perceived astrological symbols within the context of the human psyche, and how
astrology contributed insights and structural elements to his developing psychological models.
The more superficial aspects of astrology – such as the guessing-game of ‘What
is your star-sign?’ – were not beneath Jung’s notice.
Sometimes people without knowing one’s birthdate can make remarkable
guesses as to where one’s signs are. Twice it has happened to me . . . I was told
that my sun was in Leo and my moon in Taurus, Aquarius rising. This made
a great impression on me. How the devil did they know?9
This might appear a trivial comment in comparison with complex themes like the
oikodespotes. Yet an individual who appreciates the richness of Wagner, Mozart,
and Schubert may simultaneously enjoy jazz and popular music. Just as religious
currents exhibit both ‘learned’ and ‘vernacular’ expressions, so too do the spheres
of knowledge belonging to the liminal realms, and, being liminal, the distinctions
between ‘highbrow’ and ‘lowbrow’ may be fluid or even nonexistent.10 Jung’s appreciation of both the learned and the vernacular aspects of astrology was not based
on a belief in planetary or zodiacal ‘influences’ of a material kind, but on astrology’s
psychological importance as an imaginal portrayal of the cyclical qualities of time. If
Sun-sign columns had existed during the early years of his astrological studies, Jung
would no doubt have checked his horoscope every day in the Neu Zürcher Zeitung,
in between translating passages from Plotinus and the Mithras Liturgy.
Jung related the efficacy of astrology to the innate human propensity to perceive
and encapsulate the cyclical qualities of time in symbolic images, and based this idea
on a synchronistic or sympathetic relationship between microcosm (the individual
human being) and macrocosm (the collective unconscious). Jung’s approach attributes a ‘psychoid’ quality to both microcosm and macrocosm – the physical and the
psychic are expressions of a fundamental unity, rather than an ontological dualism
of spirit and matter as described in many Gnostic treatises. This links his astrology
with other symbolic frameworks and so-called mantic practices that integrate both
spiritual and material domains, such as alchemy, Tarot, and the I Ching, all of which
interested him for similar reasons. These symbolic frameworks, for Jung, reflected



180 Conclusion

fundamental human psychological patterns, most important of which was the great
journey through which the unconscious seeks to become conscious through utilising the symbol-making faculty of the imagination, thus generating an increasing
integration and fullness of the individual personality and, ultimately, of the collective psyche itself.

Scientia and Ars
Astrology, like psychology, is amenable to many definitions and cannot be viewed as
a single, monolithic body of knowledge or practice. Because it belongs to the liminal realms, astrology has agreeably clothed itself throughout its history in the garbs
of different paradigms and different cultural contexts, envisioning itself, according to time and place, as science, art, religion, divination, psychology, philosophy,
and poetic metaphor. Alexander Ruperti (1913–98), a German-born astrologer
strongly influenced by both Jung’s analytical psychology and Alice Bailey’s Theosophical writings, observed:
There is not one Astrology with a capital A. In each epoch, the astrology of
the time was a reflection of the kind of order each culture saw in celestial
motions, or the kind of relationship the culture formulated between heaven
and earth.11
The issue of ‘belief ’ in astrology (and whether Jung ‘believed’ in it) is as problematic
as defining it, since many individuals who either practise astrology themselves or
look to an astrologer for insights do not consider their attitude one of ‘belief ’ or
‘faith’, but rather, one of experience and acquired knowledge.12 It seems that Jung
was not a ‘believer’, but belonged to that group of individuals who involve themselves in astrology because, for them, it ‘works’ – although Jung, like so many other
astrologers, was never able to come up with a convincing scientific explanation of
how or why this should be so. His theory of synchronicity, while acceptable to contemporary rational modes of thought, is ultimately a rewriting of the ancient idea
of sumpatheia, couched in a language that carries no religious baggage and requires
no a priori belief in any transcendent deity. But sumpatheia, as a cosmological model,
is no less psychological than any model created by modern psychiatry, because it is
ultimately generated by the human psyche. The sharply defined boundary between
‘religion’ and ‘science’, imposed in modern times, tends to waver and dissolve in
the liminal realms of the human imagination. And attempts to ‘prove’ synchronicity
scientifically, as Jung himself demonstrated in his astrological experiment, tend to
fail because the observer, and the moment of observation, are as much part of the
experiment as the observed, and the perpetually moving cyclical qualities of time
will not stand still in order to please those seeking scientific validation.
Jung’s approach to astrology was unique for his time, and involved a profound
investigation into the interior, psychological dimensions of astrological symbolism. But within the milieu in which he worked, astrology remained, for most, a



Conclusion 181

‘belief ’ that would have rendered his psychological theories suspect if the extent
of his commitment had been widely known. Jung’s correspondence with Michael
Fordham, and Progoff ’s letter to Cary Baynes, testify to just how uncomfortable
Jung felt about any publicising of his astrological work. Today, Sun-sign columns
in newspapers and magazines are all that many individuals know of astrology, and
the apparent frivolity of such popular writings has discouraged a more serious
investigation of the subject in academic and psychotherapeutic circles. Sun-sign
columns in their present form did not exist in the early twentieth century,13 but
the prejudices against astrology were already firmly in place within the burgeoning
scientism of those decades.14 Attempting to explore Jung’s astrology from a scholarly, historical perspective requires an intellectual openness that many analysts, and
many historians – as vulnerable to the prejudices and opinions of the collective as
Jung himself was – are often not prepared to pursue.
Jung’s painful conflict between scientia and ars, poignantly described in Liber
Novus in his encounter with the giant Izdubar, was not unique to him.15 It has
existed since ancient times, evidenced in the philosophical debates between Platonists, Peripatetics, Stoics, and Sceptics, even when astrology was ‘mainstream’ and an
integral part of the religious and philosophical currents of the cultures of the time.16
Although Liber Novus is a remarkable personal testament to the depth and intensity
of Jung’s conflict, it reflects an endemic tension that might be viewed as fundamentally human, between the measurable evidence of the senses and the nonrational
evidence of inner experience. It seems that this tension has boiled and bubbled
for as long as humans have attempted to speculate on their place in the universe.
Jung’s psychological models might be seen as an individual effort to create a kind of
neutral ground where rational thought, scientific methodology – relative, naturally,
to how ‘science’ is defined in any given cultural context – and the experiential
evidence of the liminal realms can find room for engaging in a civilised dialogue.
This same effort was also being made in the world of British occultism at the turn
of the twentieth century:
The wonderful thing about the subliminal is that it provided a space for all sorts
of unnatural and supernatural phenomena to occur . . . we now had a theoretical site in which they could reside. This neutrality regarding the veracity of
ideas in the mind made psychology a useful no man’s land in late Victorian
England where scientists, clergymen and spiritualists could happily meet.17
Only if one is entirely wedded to the ‘Spirit of This Time’ – the belief that empirical
science constitutes the only authoritative world-view – can the potential value of
such an approach be dismissed. But even the neutral ground of the ‘subliminal’ has
become a battlefield. Academic research into this terrain has apparently divided itself
into two camps, the ‘religionists’ (who are often also practitioners) and the ‘empirichistorical camp’ (who are usually not); and warnings have been issued that the future
of the study of esotericism as an academic discipline may be compromised ‘if a considerable part of its representatives refuses to respect the distinction between research



182 Conclusion

and the expression of personal beliefs’.18 This statement, although apparently favouring empiricism, expresses in itself a personal belief in an ideal of pure objectivity,
and the question might reasonably be raised whether it is in fact possible for any
human to achieve such objectivity, devoid of any personal agenda. In his astrological
experiment, Jung attempted valiantly to achieve results as free as possible from the
‘expression of personal beliefs’ but, as he himself acknowledged, the results of any
experiment, however scientifically rigorous, are ultimately vulnerable to the psyche
of the researcher. It is possible that the conflict that plagued Jung, and which continues in many circles regarding his involvement with astrology and kindred ‘mantic
arts’, cannot be resolved, but only explored with a reasonable degree of reflexivity –
an attitude on the part of the researcher that acknowledges the inevitable liability to
impose personal opinions on the discussion, yet attempts to ‘bracket’ those opinions
as much as possible. It was in this spirit that Jung declared:
Every psychology – my own included – has the character of a subjective
confession . . . Every psychology which is the work of one man is subjectively
coloured.19

The ‘spirit of this time’
A number of Jung’s ideas seem to have been inspired by Plato, whose mistrust of
collective opinion, in contrast to the individual capacity for knowledge acquired
through reason, is evident in many of his Dialogues.20
Right opinions are a fine thing and do all sorts of good so long as they stay in
their place, but they will not stay long. They run away from a man’s mind; so
they are not worth much until you tether them by working out the reason . . .
Once they are tied down, they become knowledge, and are stable. That is
why knowledge is something more valuable than right opinion.21
Like Plato, Jung was suspicious of what he understood as ‘mass psychology’ – a
perception which has sometimes been interpreted as ‘elitist’, but which in fact has
little to do with issues of class, education, or economics.22 ‘Mass psychology’, for
Jung, involves the human willingness – regardless of birth, social standing, schooling, or material circumstances – to abandon individual reason, values, experience,
and consciousness in order to enjoy the safety of merging with the group, which
may then demand licence to vent unconscious fear, aggression, hatred, and greed
without the necessity for reflection or responsibility.
All mass movements, as one might expect, slip with the greatest ease down
an inclined plane represented by large numbers. Where the many are, there is
security; what the many believe must of course be true; what the many want
must be worth striving for, and necessary, and therefore good. In the clamor
of the many there lies the power to snatch wish-fulfillments by force . . .



Conclusion 183

Wherever social conditions of this type develop on a large scale the road to
tyranny lies open and the freedom of the individual turns into spiritual and
physical slavery.23
Jung lived through the devastation of two world wars that were driven by mass psychology, just as Plato lived through the thirty-year-long Peloponnesian War with
its successive and increasingly cynical changes of government from aristocracy to
oligarchy to democracy to tyranny; and it might be argued that, given their experiences, both Jung and Plato had considerable justification for their mistrust.24
Also like Plato, Jung also placed enormous value on individual responsibility as
the key to the welfare of the collective:25
If things go wrong in the world, this is because something is wrong with the
individual, because something is wrong with me. Therefore, if I am sensible,
I shall put myself right first. For this I need – because outside authority no
longer means anything to me – a knowledge of the innermost foundations
of my being, in order that I may base myself firmly on the eternal facts of the
human psyche.26
Although he was committed to astrology, Jung did not ‘blame’ the planetary configurations for life’s vicissitudes, nor did he assume that fate was an external, irrevocable force imposed by an impersonal celestial order. As Shakespeare’s Cassius
declares: ‘The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves’ – but not, in
Jung’s view, because humans are ‘underlings’.27 Rather, the ‘fault’ is the individual’s
reluctance to look within, resulting in those chains of unconscious choices and
consequences, generated by unknown compulsions, that appear to fate not only
individual lives, but also the life and history of the collective.28
The ‘Spirit of This Time’, as it gradually reveals itself in the first decades of the
twenty-first century, seems to exhibit a preference for avoiding those ‘big’ questions
that preoccupied Jung throughout his life. The nature of evil, the meaning and purpose of an individual life, the deeper motivations that drive individuals and collectives, and the enigma of human suffering, are not popular subjects for discourse in
many psychological circles these days, not least because such subjects are potential
minefields of politically incorrect observations. Instead, efforts are focused on finding methods – medicinal, psychotherapeutic, or social – that will dispel symptoms
without investing time and expense in exploring their unconscious causes. Nor is
history – whether individual or collective – perceived any longer as an essential tool
in understanding the dilemmas of the present. According to the British National
Health Service website, cognitive behavioural therapy
is a type of talking therapy that can help you to manage your problems by
changing the way you think and behave . . . CBT deals with your current
problems, rather than focusing on issues from your past. It looks for practical
ways to improve your state of mind on a daily basis.29



184 Conclusion

The efficacy of such an approach is, like that of all psychotherapeutic methods, the
subject of ongoing debate.30 In an effort to combine the best of both worlds, some
psychotherapists and therapeutic training groups have blended cognitive and analytic techniques to produce an ‘integral’ model.31 But ‘CBT’ is the approach presently favoured by collective authorities in Britain, and psychotherapeutic training
groups of all persuasions – including Jungian groups – are currently under pressure
to adopt cognitive methods if their practitioners wish to secure referrals and funding from the National Health Service.32
The difficulty may ultimately lie, not in the lack of usefulness of cognitive
techniques, but in the amputation of a sense of continuity with the past that can
sometimes result from a focus solely on present conditions and circumstances.
Understanding the interior dimensions of human history – whether this is explored
through the history of ideas, the history of religions, or the emotional history of a
family and its story through the generations – may turn out to be the pivot on which
any hope of a better future turns. This was Jung’s own perspective. He described it
vividly when he wrote about the multi-storeyed house that he called ‘my house’,
which appeared in a dream he experienced while still working with Freud. The
upper story of Jung’s dream-house was furnished in ‘rococo style’. The ground
floor was much older, dating from the fifteenth or sixteenth century. A stone stairway led down to a cellar, which dated from Roman times. When Jung looked more
closely at the floor of this cellar, he noticed a ring by which he could lift one of the
stone slabs. Yet another staircase descended into the depths, in which he discovered
‘scattered bones and broken pottery, like remains of a primitive culture’.33 Jung
interpreted the dream as ‘a kind of image of the psyche’. The rococo salon, well
above the ground, represented personal consciousness; the ground floor symbolised
the first level of the unconscious. The deeper Jung descended, the darker the scene
became, and the older and more universal the remains:
This was my first inkling of a collective a priori beneath the personal psyche. This I first took to be the traces of earlier modes of functioning. With
increasing experience and on the basis of more reliable knowledge, I recognised them as forms of instinct, that is, as archetypes.34
History, for Jung, was not a linear listing of isolated events or, as a character in one
of Alan Bennett’s plays puts it, ‘just one f - -g thing after another’.35 The deeper,
more interior history of human creativity and destructiveness was fundamental to
Jung’s psychological understanding. Astrology, as he pointed out, encapsulated the
psychology of the past and provided the foundations for psychology’s own history.
Jung, in contrast to the ‘Spirit of This Time’, shared Goethe’s view of the central
importance of history:
Let him who fails to learn and mark
Three thousand years, still stay,
Void of experience, in the dark,
And live from day to day.36



Conclusion 185

The ‘Spirit of This Time’ also appears to embrace the comfortable certainty that
the individual’s problems stem from a social, economic, or even climatic source
rather than a psychological one, and that those problems can be ‘cured’ with the
right government, the right legislation, and the right reassurances from a scientific
establishment that too often believes itself to be, like an infallible pope, incapable
of misjudgement or ignorance, even in the liminal spheres where its instruments
of measurement may be inadequate or inappropriate. Jung’s allegiance, in spite of
himself and at the cost of considerable suffering, was ultimately and irrevocably
given to what he understood as the ‘Spirit of the Depths’, and the older religious
and philosophical currents that he studied so assiduously appeared to him as varying forms of a perpetually renewed human effort to express that Spirit – even if the
prevailing collective world-view opposed it.

Invoking the ‘spirit of the depths’
That Jung worked with ritual invocations of the planetary archetypes he identified
in his own horoscope, and that the results of these invocations infuse many of the
characters in Liber Novus, might seem a disturbing and even shocking suggestion
to those who are unfamiliar with the historical roots of the technique Jung called
active imagination. But the relationship between magic and active imagination
was described by Jung himself, and the suggestion that he was unable to make his
own connections between the theurgic rituals of late antiquity and the ‘pursuit of
the inner images’ that resulted in Liber Novus is unconvincing. Jung also made it
clear that he understood the planetary ‘gods’ as archetypes, and that the purpose
of active imagination is to establish a dialogue between the archetypal potencies
and individual human consciousness. His interest in medieval and early modern
grimoires, astrologically inclined magical texts such as the Mithras Liturgy, and Neoplatonic theurgists such as Plotinus, Iamblichus, and Proclus, who all integrated
astrology into their cosmological perceptions, underlines the likelihood that Jung
made a deliberate and conscious effort to work imaginally – or, put another way,
­magically – with the internal conflicts that he believed were symbolically portrayed
in his birth chart.
The purpose of such inner work, for Jung as for his predecessors in late antiquity,
was a transformation of the personality through the integration of consciousness
with the larger psychic centre that Jung understood as the Self. Although Iamblichus and his fellow theurgists variously interpreted that centre as a god or daimon,
or as the Platonic One from which all else emanates, their pursuit of this process of
integration through the use of symbols and images, firmly based on the underpinning of the idea of sumpatheia, reappears in Jung’s concept of individuation and the
work which he suggested might be done by the individual to facilitate an otherwise
natural but unconscious, sometimes unnecessarily painful, and even unsuccessful
journey. Jung was fond of citing the alchemical axiom, ‘What nature leaves imperfect, the art perfects’,37 and – allowing for his preference for the idea of wholeness
rather than the idea of perfection – this is the goal of the psychotherapy that he
developed and practiced.



186 Conclusion

Jung understood fate in general, and astral fate in particular, as a paradox. From
the astrologer’s perspective, one cannot send one’s horoscope back and order a new
one, unless one espouses a religious conviction that promises a new horoscope
coincident with a new spiritual ‘rebirth’, as the Christian theologian Tatian did
in the second century ce.38 Although some astrologers accept the idea that fate is
concrete and fixed, more psychologically inclined astrologers understand fate as
multi-levelled and negotiable. In Jung’s view, horoscopic fate presents a profound
conundrum. Ultimately one must ‘do gladly and freely that which one must do’;
but those operative adverbs, ‘gladly’ and ‘freely’, imply a voluntary conscious cooperation with the ‘eternal facts’ – the archetypes themselves – that cannot be coerced
or eradicated through any human effort. Free will, for Jung, involved respect for,
and acceptance of, the will of the daimon, while simultaneously encompassing a
dialogue and potential transformation that could allow both the personality and the
daimon to flower in the most creative possible way.
In Jung’s context, this marriage of personality with Self does not depend on,
or result in, perfection, and the suggestion that one can ‘transcend’, ‘overcome’, or
‘cure’ the difficult dimensions of a natal horoscope would have seemed as absurd to
him as bowing one’s head and accepting a fate-imposed suffering without attempting to understand why. Wholeness was the ideal toward which Jung aspired, and it
requires living with the conflicts symbolised by the horoscope in ways that might
sometimes involve struggle and failure, but which ultimately acknowledge meaning and teleology in those conflicts, along with loyalty to the truth of oneself. The
I Ching, which Jung viewed as the Eastern equivalent to Western astrology, offers a
similar paradoxical perception:
They [the holy sages] put themselves in accord with tao and its power, and
in conformity with this laid down the order of what is right. By thinking
through the order of the outer world to the end, and by exploring the
law of their nature to the deepest core, they arrived at an understanding
of fate.39
In psychological as well as astrological realms, experience, for Jung, ultimately carried greater weight than intellectual speculation and scientific methodologies, even
in the teeth of the most persuasive rational argument, and even when that argument
was presented by his own scientifically trained intellect. In October 1959, toward
the end of his life, Jung was interviewed by the television presenter John Freeman
for a BBC programme titled Face to Face. Freeman asked Jung whether he still
believed in God, and Jung replied:
Now? Difficult to answer. I know. I needn’t, I don’t need to believe. I know.
Freeman did not ask Jung whether he ‘believed’ in astrology. But it is likely that the
answer would have been the same.
