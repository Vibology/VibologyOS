*"Astrology is the language of time—the syntax by which cosmic forces speak to embodied consciousness. The chart is not prediction but revelation: the blueprint of potentials waiting to be chosen, ignored, or transcended. To read the sky is to read the soul, and to honor the transits is to trust that becoming has its own geometry."*
