# Oracles
*The Art of Consulting the I-Ching*

---

> **Note:** This entry is a structural stub. Core framework established; detailed content pending.

---

## Overview

**Oracular consultation** is the traditional practice of using the I-Ching as a divination tool—casting hexagrams in response to questions to receive guidance from the wisdom encoded in the 64 [[Hexagrams]].

Unlike fortune-telling (which predicts fixed futures), I-Ching divination reveals the **archetypal pattern** of the present moment and its likely development—allowing the questioner to respond wisely rather than passively accept fate.

## The Casting Methods

### Yarrow Stalk Method (Traditional)
The original method using 50 yarrow stalks, with complex manipulation to generate each line. Takes 20-30 minutes per hexagram.

**Advantages:** Meditative, deliberate, traditional
**Process:** Divide stalks, count remainders, derive line values

### Three-Coin Method (Simplified)
Three coins tossed six times to generate the hexagram.

**Line Values:**
- 3 heads (3×3=9) = Old Yang (—o) → moving line, transforms to Yin
- 2 heads + 1 tail (3+3+2=8) = Young Yin (- -)
- 1 head + 2 tails (3+2+2=7) = Young Yang (—)
- 3 tails (2×3=6) = Old Yin (--x) → moving line, transforms to Yang

**Advantages:** Quick, accessible, portable

### Digital Methods
Software or apps that simulate random casting.

**Advantages:** Instant, convenient
**Disadvantages:** Lacks physical/ritual engagement—may reduce synchronistic attunement

## The Consultation Process

### 1. Formulate the Question
- Clear, specific, open-ended
- Focus on the present situation, not yes/no outcomes
- "What do I need to understand about...?" rather than "Should I...?"

### 2. Center and Cast
- Enter a receptive mental state
- Cast the hexagram with intention
- Build from bottom line (1) to top line (6)

### 3. Identify the Hexagram
- Note any moving lines (old Yang or old Yin)
- Identify the primary hexagram
- If moving lines exist, derive the relating hexagram

### 4. Read and Contemplate
- Read the Judgment and Image
- Read the specific moving line texts
- Consider the relating hexagram as the situation's evolution

### 5. Apply the Guidance
- Translate archetypal language to your specific situation
- Take action aligned with the oracle's counsel
- Return to the oracle if circumstances change significantly

## Oracular Ethics

- **One question, one casting:** Don't re-cast hoping for a "better" answer
- **Respect the response:** Even difficult hexagrams contain wisdom
- **Act on guidance:** Consulting without acting is spiritual entertainment
- **Appropriate questions:** Ask about your own path, not others' private matters
