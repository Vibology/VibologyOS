# Session Summary: 2026-01-08

## Overview
Established foundational infrastructure for VibologyOS: NotebookLM integration, comprehensive Library architecture, and 28-week strategic build plan.

---

## 🔧 Technical Setup

### NotebookLM Authentication (First-Time Setup)
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **Action:** Configured persistent authentication for `~/.claude/skills/notebooklm/`
- **Result:** Browser session state saved; future queries will not require manual login
- **Notebook URL:** `https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/ed88d436-4251-4d9b-bf60-47d33110c94d`

---

## ⚛ Synthesis Work

### Projector Type: Invitation as Jungian Call
- **Request:** Fetch Projector mechanics from NotebookLM, synthesize with Jung's concept of the Call
- **Data Retrieved:**
  - Layer 1: Core mechanics (aura, Strategy, Authority, Not-Self theme)
  - Layer 2: Phenomenology of waiting, invitation psychology, energetic costs
- **Document Created:** `⚛ Synthesis/Projector_Invitation_as_Jungian_Call.md` (9.2K)
- **Format:** Dual-persona (Scribe: raw mechanics | Weaver: mythopoetic synthesis)
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Invitation as [[Call to Adventure]] that cannot be self-authored
  - Premature initiation as [[False Hero]] archetype
  - Bitterness as crystallized [[Shadow]]
  - Correct invitation activating [[Transcendent Function]]
  - Recognition as [[Syzygy]] of self-worth
  - Sacred passivity vs. spiritual bypassing

## 📋 Strategic Planning

### Library Build Strategy Document
- **File:** `◈ System/Library Build Strategy.md`
- **Timeline:** 28 weeks across 7 phases
- **Approach:** Phased content population prioritized for consultation work

### Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Duration | Core Pillar | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Weeks 1-4 | Human Design Core | Tier 1 consultations enabled |
| 2 | Weeks 5-8 | Astrology Foundations | Tier 2 natal synthesis |
| 3 | Weeks 9-12 | Tarot & Qabalah | Pathworking guidance |
| 4 | Weeks 13-16 | The Window + Gates | All 64 gates/patterns |
| 5 | Weeks 17-20 | Folklore + Angelology | Mythic synthesis |
| 6 | Weeks 21-24 | Advanced Mechanics | Professional HD analysis |
| 7 | Weeks 25-28 | Magdalene Path | Complete Syn-Gnosis system |

### Content Creation Protocols
- **Voice:** Weaver persona (scholarly, evocative, numinous)
- **Review:** User edits all generated content
- **Sources:** NotebookLM + synthesis + cross-system correspondences
- **Maintenance:** Weekly additions, monthly cross-link review, quarterly refinement

### Key Decisions Confirmed
1. ✅ 28-week timeline accepted
2. ✅ Priority order: HD → Astro → Tarot → Window → Folklore → Advanced → Magdalene
3. ✅ All 64 gates in Phase 4 (not partial set)
4. ✅ Weaver voice with user review/edit workflow
5. ✅ Anonymized case studies deferred to appropriate time
