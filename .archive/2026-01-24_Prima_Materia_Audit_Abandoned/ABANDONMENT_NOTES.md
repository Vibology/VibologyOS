# Prima Materia Audit - Abandoned 2026-01-24

## Reason for Abandonment

Critical methodological error discovered: The audit was intended to verify content traces to the **Esoteric Grimoire in NotebookLM**, but the remediation approach added traditional academic citations (Campbell, Jung CW, Vogler, etc.) as if writing scholarly papers.

This misunderstood the purpose of Prima Materia verification - we should have been verifying content EXISTS in the Grimoire and citing the Grimoire itself, not creating an academic citation apparatus.
